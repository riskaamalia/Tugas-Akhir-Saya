756, sadum is one of the traditional cloths of the batak people in north sumatra it is woven on a back strap loom with supplementary weft technique sadum is a warp faced weaving made of cotton and beads woven into the cloth ritually it is used as a shoulder cloth gifts exchanges and in dances it also bears the symbol of good tidings and blessings for the receiver the cloth has change during times in technique color patterns as well as in functions but the use as a ritual cloth stays the same the basic weaving techniques and equipments used to create it hasnft change but its material and added techniques has made this cloth become more rich in color pattern and texture most changes began when the europeans came to indonesia and introduced new material such as synthetic fibers and colors in the 70s traditional cloth of indonesia got its boost when the government declared batik as indonesian national attire this encourages other traditional weavings to develop into contemporary clothing later new techniques and material were introduced to the sadum weavings including embroidery silk and golden threads which were never used before keywords sadum traditional ulos weaving batak traditional weaving is called ulos which literally means blanket ulos is a woven fabric commonly 50 to 150 cm in width and 150 to 220 cm in length and made of cotton fiber threads motif designing in ulos is achieved through several techniques such as supplementary weft songket warp ikat and application of beads in the traditional life of batak people ulos plays inseparable significant roles especially those related to tradition and local religion there are actually several kinds of ulos with different traditional significances such as ragidup ragihotang sadum sibolang bintang maratur mangiring 1 every ulos fabric possesses distinct ornaments which differentiate one from another among various types of ulos having traditional significances sadum is the most common sadum is distinguishable from other types of ulos due to its bright colors like other types of ulos sadum features also warp-faced background except for the portion of the motif formed using songket supplementary weft technique sadum also features more color variations than other types of ulos this traditional fabric is worn by both men 168 ratna panggabean and women in both delightful and mournful occasions this general characteristic renders the traditional fabric open to developments figure 1 sadum tarutung cotton late 19th century collection of dr poltak hutagalung figure 2 backstrap loom anas 1995 sadum is produced in tarutung north sumatera as a type of publicly consumed ulos this traditional fabric is sold in local markets major cities and tourism souvenir centers sadum is commonly 55 120 in width and 150 200 cm in length and traditionally woven by women using the backstrap loom this loom can only produce a limited width of fabric to produce a sheet of fabric sadum traditional and contemporary 169 wider than 100 cm the weaving process involves two long sheets of fabric with a symmetrical motif which are later combined into a unified sheet the motifs on the sheet are applied through structure design which means that the motifs are created simultaneously along with the weaving process the techniques used are songket supplementary weft and application of beads in the weaving the remainder of the warp thread at the edge of the sheet is knit horizontally as the seal of the weaving while the remaining thread is spun to shape tassels weaving the sheets using the back strap loom allows for denser and more solid thread structures and plaits which in turn produces soft fine and heavy sheets sadum among other traditional batak fabrics has the richest color variation besides the traditional red white and black sadum also features bright colors such as blue yellow and green these colors are obtained from indigenous plants such as mengkudu awl tree morinda citrifolia which produces red indigo indigofera tinctoria produces blue and turmeric curcuma domestica which produces yellow 2 sadum ornaments basically consist of three main lines on the arrangements of warp threads which are usually dark red and blue the motifs are latter woven using the supplementary weft technique songket following the direction of the weft usually in yellow and green one of the most distinctive motifs in sadum is the horizontal line which was entirely woven using the weft threads in bright colors the motif on this line is commonly diamond-shaped other motifs are stylization of natural objects arranged on horizontal lines above the diamond-shaped motif figure 3 one of the distinctive motif of sadum a horizontal line with diamond shaped patterns woven in bright colors collection of dr poltak hutagalung 170 ratna panggabean according to batak culture sadum represents joy and blessing and appears in almost every ritual of both delight marriage birth and grief death it is not uncommon that words of hope and blessing are woven on sadum as traditional clothing sadum is commonly worn as a shoulder cloth for man or woman in traditional dances sadum is also worn as body covering sarong breast covering and headwear for women 3 in rituals sadum is presented as a symbol of blessing for the receiver and is common in gift exchange rituals sadum is also utilized as traditional equipment usually as a coaster or cover of other traditional artifacts the appearance of sadum which is rich in colors and beads contains a positive traditional meaning which attracts the general public as message bearer and gift this traditional fabric may be presented to anyone including those outside the batak society thus sadum may be produced with certain adjustment and diversification in its forms and functions to anticipate a larger market for this reason sadum is produced in different degrees of quality according to its role in rituals for instance the quality of sadum for rituals is not as high as sadum for clothing message bearer and gift the consideration of the quality of sadum as a traditional fabric covers motif sophistication variation of colors and density of weaving figure 4 parents of the groom cover the shoulders of the bride bridegroom with a sadum as token blessings courtesy of s e hutapea since the arrival of western civilization in the early 19th century for disseminating christianity and later colonization the production of sadum also underwent development in techniques materials and background motifs in the past every batak women

724, a polymer electrolyte membrane widely used in pemfcs and dmfcs is a perfluorosulfonated membrane the nafion membrane this perfluorosulfonated membrane material exhibits good chemical stability and proton conductivity but it is very expensive and difficult to recycle there is a high methanol crossover in dmfcs that causes a decrease in efficiency and performance of the fuel cell so that a polymer electrolyte membrane with a low methanol crossover is needed as a substitute for the nafion membrane one of the materials that can be used as a polymer electrolyte membrane is the polyblends from sulfonated polystyrene-lignosulfonate sps-ls such polyblends were prepared by casting a polymer solution and characterized as polyelectrolyte membrane for dmfcs the sps was prepared by sulfonation of polystyrene with acetyl sulfate as the sulfonating agent the membranes of the sps-ls were characterized by analysis of functional groups mechanical properties and methanol permeability the maximum mechanical properties of the sps-ls membrane were observed at an ls ratio of 7.5 however the methanol permeability of the membrane increased with the increase of the ls ratio in the sps-ls membranes the properties of the membranes especially their mechanical properties and methanol permeability were close to that of nafion 117 membrane so sps-ls membranes have high potential for use as polymer electrolyte membrane for direct methanol fuel cells keywords dmfc lignosulfonate polymer electrolyte membrane polystyrene sulfonated 1
