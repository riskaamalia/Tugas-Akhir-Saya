Abstract. A C- algebra is the algebraic form of the 3-valued conditional logic, 
which was introduced by F. Guzman and C.C. Squier in 1990. In this paper, 
some equivalent conditions for a C- algebra to become a boolean algebra in 
terms of congruences are given. It is proved that the set of all central elements 
B(A) is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra ( )S AB of all C-algebras Sa, where a 
 B(A). It is also proved that B(A) is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra ( )R AB
of all C-algebras Aa, where a B(A).  
Keywords: Boolean algebra; C-algebra; central element; permutable congruences. 
1 Introduction 
The concept of C-algebra was introduced by Guzman and Squier as the variety 
generated by the 3-element algebra C={T,F,U}. They proved that the only 
subdirectly irreducible C-algebras are either C or the 2-element Boolean algebra 
B ={T,F} [1,2]. 
For any universal algebra A, the set of all congruences on A (denoted by Con A) 
is a lattice with respect to set inclusion. We say that the congruences ,  are 
permutable if =? ? . We say that Con A is permutable if =? ?  
for all ACon , . It is known that Con A need not be permutable for any C-
algebra A. 
In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for congruences on a C-algebra A to 
be permutable. Also we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a C-
algebra A to become a Boolean algebra in terms of the congruences on A. We 
also prove that the three Boolean algebras B(A), the set of C-algebras ( )S AB and 
the set of C-algebras ( )R AB are isomorphic to each other. 
 Boolean Algebra of C-Algebras 205 
 
2 Preliminaries 
In this section we recall the definition of a C-algebra and some results from 
[1,3,5] which will be required later. 
Definition 2.1. By a C -algebra we mean an algebra > ,,,< A  of type 
(2,2,1) satisfying the following identities [1]. 
(a)  = ;x x   
(b) ( ) = ;x y x y  
(c) ( ) = ( ) ;x y z x y z   
(d) ( ) = ( ) ( );x y z x y x z  
(e) ( )  = ( ) ( );x y z x z x y z  
(f) ( ) = ;x x y x   
(g) ( ) ( ) = ( ) ( ).x y y x y x x y  
Example 2.2. [1]: 
The 3- element algebra C={T, F, U} is a C-algebra with the operations ,  
and   defined as in the following tables. 
 
x x    T F U   T F U 
T F  T T F U  T T T T 
F T  F F F F  F T F U 
U U  U U U U  U U U U 
 
Every Boolean algebra is a C-algebra. 
 
Lemma 2.3. Every C-algebra satisfies the following laws [1,3,5]. 
(a)  = ;x x x  
(b) = ( )x y x x y = ( ) ;x y x  
(c) ( ) = ;x x x x  
(d) ( )  = ( ) ( );x x y x y x y  
(e) ( )  = ;x x x x  
(f)  = ;x x x x  
(g)  = ;x y x x y  
(h)  = ;x x y x x  
(i) ( ) = ( ) .x y x x y x   
The duals of all above statements are also true.  
206 G.C. Rao & P. Sundarayya 
Definition 2.4. If A  has identity T for  ( that is, = =x T T x x  for all 
Ax ), then it is unique and in this case, we say that A is a C -algebra with T. 
We denote 'T by F and this F is the identity for  [1]. 
Lemma 2.5 [1]: Let A be a C -algebra with T and yx,  A. Then 
(i) =x y F  if and only if = =x y F  
(ii) if  = x y T  then x x  = .T   
(iii) Tx = xx   
(iv) xxFx = . 
Theorem 2.6. Let > ,,,< A  be a C-algebra. Then the following are 
equivalent [6]:  
(i) A is a Boolean algebra.  
(ii) ( ) = ,x y x x  for all Ayx, .  
(iii) = ,x y y x  for all Ayx, . 
(iv) ( , = ) yyyx  for all Ayx, . 
(v) xx  is the identity for ,  for every Ax . 
(vi) xx  = ,yy  for all Ayx, . 
(vii) A has a right zero for .  
(viii) for any Ayx, , there exists Aa  such that .== aayax  
(ix) for any Ayx, , if yyx = , then .= xxy  
Definition 2.7. Let A be a C-algebra with T. An element Ax  is called a 
central element of A if Txx = . The set of all central elements of A is called 
the Centre of A and is denoted by B(A) [5]. 
Theorem 2.8. Let A be a C-algebra with T .Then >  ,,),(< AB  is a Boolean 
Algebra [5]. 
3 Some Properties of a C -algebra and Its Congruences 
In this section we prove some important properties of a C-algebra and we give 
sufficient conditions for two congruences on a C-algebra A to be permutable. 
Also we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a C-algebra A to become 
a Boolean algebra in terms of the congruences on A. 
Lemma 3.1. Every C-algebra satisfies the following identities: 
 Boolean Algebra of C-Algebras 207 
 
(i) = ( );x y x y x  
(ii) = ( ).x y x y x  
Proof. Let A be a C-algebra and , .x y A  Now,  
= ( ) = ( ) = [ ( )] [ ( ( ))] =
[ ( )] [ ( )] = [ ( )] [ ( )] = ( )
( ) = ( ).  Similarly  = ( ).
x y x x y x x y x x x x x y x x x
x x x x y x x x x x x x y x x x y
x x x y x x y x y x
 
Lemma 3.2. Let A be a C-algebra and , .x y A  Then = .x y x x y y  
Proof. Let A be a C-algebra and , .x y A  By Lemma 2.3[b],[f] and Lemma 
3.1, we have = (( ) ) = [ ( )] = ( )x y x x y x y x y x y x y  
= = .y x y y x y y  
Lemma 3.3. Let A  be a C-algebra with , , and = .T x y A x y F  Then 
= .x y y x   
Proof. Suppose that = .x y F  Then = = ( ) = ( )F x y x x y x x
( ) = ( ) = .x y x x F x x  now = ( ) = ( ) ( )x y F x y x y x y
= ( ) ( )x x y x y x y  (By Def 2.1) = ( ) ( )x y x y x  (By 
2.3[g]) = ( ) ( ) = ( ) = .x x y x F y x y x  
In [6], it is proved that if A is a C-algebra with T then ( ) = { |B A a A
= }a a T  is a Boolean algebra under the same operations  ,,  in the C-
algebra A. Now we prove the following.  
Theorem 3.4. Let A be a C-algebra with T and Aba,  such that 
)(ABba . Then ).(ABa   
Proof. Let A be a C-algebra with T and Aba,  such that ).(ABba  Then 
= ( ) ( )T a b a b  )()(= baba   
= ( ) ( )a b a a b b  = ( ) ( )a b a a b a  (By Theorem 3.2)  
= a b a .  
Therefore, =T a b a  ...(I)  
208 G.C. Rao & P. Sundarayya 
Now,   = ( )
= ( ) ( )     (by(I))
= ( ( )) ( ( ))
= ( ( ))
= ( )      (By 2.3[b])
= = .
a a a a T
a a a b a
a a b a a a b a
a a a b a
a a b a
a b a T
  
Hence ( ).a B A  
The converse of the above theorem need not be true. For example, in the C-
algebra , ( )C F B C  but = ( ).F U U B C  We have the following 
consequence of the above theorem. 
Corollary 3.5. Let A be a C-algebra with T, ,a b A  and ( )a b B A . Then 
( ).a B A   
Proof. Let ( ).a b B A  Then we have, ( ) ( ) ( )a b B A a b B A
 ( )  ( ).a B A a B A  
In [1], it is proved that if A is a C-algebra, then = {( , ) | = }x p q x p x q  is 
a congruence on A and =x x x x . In [6], if A is C-algebra with T then x  
is a factor congruence if and only if ( ).x B A  They also proved that yx ,  are 
permutable congruences whenever both , ( )x y B A . Now we prove some 
important properties of these congruences.  
Theorem 3.6. Let A be a C-algebra with T and ,a b A . Then we have the 
following (i) = ;a b b a (ii) a b a b? . 
Proof. (i) bayx ),(   
 
ybaxba = 
  
 xbabxbab =   
 xabxab =   
 abyx ),(   
Therefore a b b a . Similarly, baab . Hence .= abba

(ii) Let ( , ) .a bx y ?  Then there exists Az  such that ( , ) bx z  and 
( , ) .az y  Thus =b x b z  and = .a z a y  Now, =a b x a b
= = = .z a b a z a b a y a b y  Therefore, ( , ) .a bx y  Thus 
.a b a b?  
In the following we give an example of a C-algebra G without T in which the 
Con A is not permute.

Theorem 3.8. Let A a C-algebra with T and ( )a B A . Then for any 
, ,a bb A  permute and =a b a b? .  
Proof. Let A be a C-algebra with T and )(ABa . By Theorem 3.6,
.a b a b?  Now let ( , ) .a bp q  Then =  a b p a b q b a b
= = .p b a b q b a p b a q  Consider, )()(= qapar . 
Now = [( ) ( )] = ( ) ( ) = ( ) ( )a r a a p a q a p a a q a p F q
= ( ) .a p F a p  Therefore ( , )  ( , )a ar p p r . Now, =b r  
[( ) ( )] = [ ] [ ] = ( ) ( )b a p a q b a p b a q b a q b a q
= (( ) ( )) = (( ) ) = ( ) b a q a q b a a q b T q (since ( ))a B A  
= b q . Therefore ( , )  ( , ) .b bq r r q  Thus ( , ) b ap q ? . Hence 
=b a a b? . Thus b a?  is a congruence on A and hence ,a b  are 
permutable congruences and hence = = .a b b a a b? ?    
Corollary 3.9. Let A be a C-algebra with T and ,a b A . Then i) 
( )  = ;a b a ba b B A ?  ii) ( )  =a b a ba b B A ? . 
Proof. i) We know that if )(ABba  then )(ABa  and hence by the above 
theorem = =a b b a a b? ? . Similarly, we can prove ii). 
Let A be a C-algebra. If Con(A) is permutable, then A need not be a Boolean 
algebra. For example, in the C-algebra C, the only congruences are ,  and 
they are permutable. But C is not a Boolean algebra. Now we give equivalent 
conditions for a C-algebra to become a Boolean algebra in terms of congruence 
relations. 
Theorem 3.10. Let ( , , , )A  be a C-algebra with T. Then the following are 
equivalent. (i) Let ( , , , )A  be a Boolean algebra. (ii) =x x  for all 
.x A  (iii) =x x  for all x A . 
 Boolean Algebra of C-Algebras 211 
 
Proof. (1) (2): Let A be a Boolean algebra and x A . Let ( , ) .x xp q  
Then x p x q  and = .x p x q  Now, = ( ) = ( )p x x p x p
( ) = ( ) ( ) = ( ) = .x q x q x q x x q q  Thus .xx  Therefore 
.=xx  Since ,= xxxx  we get (ii) (iii). (iii) (i): Suppose 
=xx  for all .Ax  We prove that = .x x A A?  Let ( , )p q A A. 
Write ).()(= qxpxt  Now, = (( ) ( )) = ( )x t x x p x q x p
( ) =x x q ( ) ( ) = ( ) = .x p x x x p x x p
 
Also, =x t x
(( ) ( )) = ( ) ( )) = ( ) ( )) = ( (x p x q x x p x x q x x x q x x
)) = .q x q  Therefore ( , ) xp t  and ( , ) .xt q  Thus ( , ) x xp q ? . 
Hence we get = .x x A A?  Also = = .x x x x  That is x  and x  
are permutable factor congruences. Therefore, by Theorem 2.6, we have 
( ).x B A  Thus = ( )A B A  and hence A is a Boolean algebra.  
4 The C-algebra xS  
We prove that, for each Ax , }|{= AttxSx  is itself a C-algebra under 
induced operations ,  and the unary operation is defines by ( ) 'x t x t
. We observe that Sx need not be a subalgebra of A because the unary operation 
in Sx is not the restriction of the unary operation on A. Also for each Ax , the 
set } | {= AttxAx  is a C-algebra in which the unary operation is given by 
.=)( * txtx  We prove that the B(A) is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra 
( )S AB of all C-algebras Sa where )(ABa . Also, we prove that B(A) is 
isomorphic to the Boolean algebra ( )R AB  of all C-algebras )(, ABaAa . 
 
Theorem 4.1. Let >,,,< A  be a C-algebra, Ax and }.|{= AttxSx
Then >,*,,< xS  is a C-algebra with x  as the identity for , where and 
are the operations in A restricted to Sx and for any xStx , here 
*)( tx  
is tx . 
Proof. Let Asrt ,, . Then xSrtxrxtx )(=)()(  
and ( )x t
( ) = ( ) xx r x t r S . Thus ,  are closed in Sx. Also 
*
 is closed in Sx. 
Consider txtxxtxxtx =)(=)(=)( ** . Now *[( ) ( )]x t x r
212 G.C. Rao & P. Sundarayya 
* * *= [ ( )] = ( ) = = ( ) ( ) .x t r x t r x t x r x t x r  Now, 
consider ( ) ( ) ( ) [( ) ] = ( ) ( )x t x r x s x t r s x t s t r s  
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ') ( ) ( )x t s x t r s x t x s x t x r x s
.)()()()()( sxrxtxsxtx
 
The remaining identities of a 
C-algebra also hold in Sx because they hold in A. Hence, Sx is itself a C-algebra. 
Also x  is the identity for because xtxtxtxx == . Here xx  is 
the identity for .  
Theorem 4.2. Let A be a C-algebra. Then the following holds.  
(i) yx SS =  if and only if yx = ; 
(ii) yxyx SSS ; 
(iii) xxxx SSS = ; 
(iv) yxyxx SS =)( . 
Proof. (i) Suppose yx SS = . Since yx SSxxx ==  and =y y y  
= .y xS S  Therefore tyx =  and rxy =  for some Art, . Now, 
= =x y t ( ) ( ) = ( ) ( ) = ( ) ( ) =y t y y y t x y y x y x x y
( ) ( ) = = .x r x x x r x r y  The converse is trivial. (ii) Suppose 
yx SSt . Then rysxt ==  for some ., Ars  Now, =t x x s
= = .x yx t x y r S  (iii) xxxx SSS  by (ii). Since xxxx =  
we have .xxxx SSS  Hence xxxx SSS = . (iv) ( ) ={  |x x yS x y t
} = {  | } = {  | } =x x yt S x y x r r A x y r r A S .
 
Theorem 4.3. Let A be a C-algebra with T and ,Ax  then the mapping x : 
xSA  defined by txtx =)(  for all At  is a homomorphism of A to xS  
with kernel x  and hence ./ xx SA  
Proof. Let ., Art  Then )()(===)( rtrxtxrtxrt xxx  
and 
** ))((=)(==)( ttxtxt xx . Clearly, ).()(=)( rtrt xxx  
Also ( ) = = ,x T x T x x  which is the identity for  in .xS  Therefore x  
is a homomorphism. Hence by the fundamental theorem of homomorphism 
xx SKerA/  
and = {( , ) | ( ) = ( )} = {( , )  |x x xKer t r A A t r t r A A
 Boolean Algebra of C-Algebras 213

hence ./ xx SA  
Theorem 4.4. Let A be a C-algebra with T and ),(ABa  then .aa SSA   
Proof. Define aa SSA:  by ))(),((=)( xxx aa  for all .Ax  
Then, by Theorem 4.3,  is well-defined and  is a homomorphism. Now, we 
prove that  is one-one. Let Ayx, . Then ( ) = ( ) ( ( ), ( ))a ax y x x
= ( ( ), ( )) ( , ) = ( , ) =   a ay y a x a x a y a y a x a y
 
and 
= .a x a y  Now = = ( ) = ( ) ( ) = ( )x F x a a x a x a x a y  
( ) = .a y y  Finally, we prove that  is onto. Let .),( aa SSyx  Then 
tax = , and ray =  for some Art, . Therefore, = ,a x x
= = =a y a a y T y T  and .=,= yyaTxa  Now, 
).,(=

))()(),()((=

yx
yTTx
yaxayaxa
yxayxa
yxyxyx aa
  
Therefore,  is onto and hence  is an isomorphism. Therefore .aa SSA  
 
Lemma 4.5. Let A be a C-algebra. Then for ,a b A :  
(i) =a b b a  if and only if =a b a bS S S  
(ii) },{= baba SSSupS  in the poset ( },|{ AxSx ), then .= abba  
The converse is not true. 
Proof. (i) Suppose that .= abba  Then clearly .baba SSS  By 
Theorem 4.2(ii) baba SSS . Hence baba SSS = . Conversely assume 
that .= baba SSS  Clearly = .a b a ba b S S S  Therefore ba b S  
=a b b t  for some .At  Now = = = =b a b a b b b t b t  
.a b  (ii) Assume that Aba,  and }.,{= baba SSSupS  Then abba SS =  
and hence .= abba SSba  Therefore tabba )(=  for some .At  
214 G.C. Rao & P. Sundarayya 
Now .=)(=))(()(=)()( batabtababbaab  Similarly 
we can prove that .=)()( ababba  Hence .= abba  The 
converse need not be true, for example for the C-algebra C , 
}{=},{= TSUS TU  and UTTU = . But )(= UTU SS  is not an upper 
bound of }.,{ TU SS  
Now we prove 
( ) { | ( )}S A aS a B AB  is a Boolean algebra under set 
inclusion. 
Theorem 4.6. Let >,,,< A  be a C-algebra with T. Then 
( ) ={ | ( )}S A aS a B AB  is a Boolean algebra under set inclusion. 
Proof. Clearly ( )( , )S AB  is a partially ordered set under inclusion. First we 
show for )(, ABba , baS  is the infimum of },{ ba SS  and baS  is the 
supremum of },{ ba SS  for all )(, ABba . Let )(, ABba . Then 
abba =  and .= abba  Hence by the above Lemma 4.5, baS  is the 
infimum of },{ ba SS . Let .aSt  Then xat =  for some Ax . Now 
= = ( ( )) = (t a x a a b x a ( ) = ( ) .a bb a x a b a x S  
Similarly 
.= baabb SSS  
Therefore baS  is an upper bound of ba SS , . Suppose cS  is 
an upper bound of ba SS , . baSt . Then xbat )(=  for some Ax . 
Now = ( ) = ( )t a b x a x ( ) = ( ) ( ) ca b x a x b a x S  (since 
ca SSxa , b a x b cS S  and cS  is closed under ). Therefore 
baS  is the supremum of }.,{ ba SS  Denote the supremum of },{ ba SS  by 
ba SS  and the infimum of },{ ba SS  by ba SS . Now TaTaT SSSS ==  
and FaFaF SSSS == . Therefore TS  is the least element and FS  is the 
greatest element of ( )( , )S AB . Now for any 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ), , ( ),( ) = = = = (a b c a b c a c b c a c b c aa b c B A S S S S S S S S
) ( ).c b cS S S
 
Also, Taaaa SSSS ==  and .== Faaaa SSSS
Therefore ( )( , )S AB  is a complimented distributive lattice and hence it is a 
Boolean algebra.  
 Boolean Algebra of C-Algebras 215 
 
Theorem 4.7. Let A be a C-algebra with T Define ( ): ( ) S AB A B  by 
asa =)(  for all ).(ABa  Then  is an isomorphism. 
Proof. Let )(, ABba . Then ( )( ) = = = ( ) ( ).a b a ba b S S S a b
( )( ) = = = ( ) ( )a b a ba b S S S a b , 
( ) = = ( ) = ( ( )) .a aa S S a
Clearly  is both one-one and onto. Hence ( )( ) .S AB A B  
In [3] we defined a partial ordering on a C-algebra by yx  if and only if 
xxy =  and we studied the properties of this partial ordering. We gave a 
number of equivalent conditions in terms of this partial ordering for a C-algebra 
to become a Boolean algebra. In [4] we proved that, for each Ax , 
Ax ={s A | s x} is itself a C-algebra under induced operations  ,  and 
the unary operation is defined by sxs =* we also observed that xA  need not 
be an algebra of A because the unary operation in xA  is not the restriction of 
the unary operation. For each ,Ax  we proved that xA is isomorphic to the 
quotient algebra xA/  where }=|),{(= qxpxAAqpx . We can 
easily see that the C-algebras xx AS ,  are different in general where .Ax  
Now, we prove that the set of all aA 's where )(ABa  is a Boolean algebra 
under set inclusion. The following theorem can be proved analogous to 
Theorem 4.6.  
Theorem 4.8. Let A be a C-algebra with T. Then 
( ) :={ | ( )}R A aA a B AB  is a 
Boolean Algebra under set inclusion in which the supremum of 
baba AAA =},{  and the infimum of .=},{ baba AAA  
 
The proof of the following theorem is analogous to that of Theorem 4.7.  
 
Theorem 4.9. Let A be a C-algebra with T Define ( ): ( ) R Af B A B  by 
aAaf =)(  for all ).(ABa  Then f  is an isomorphism.
