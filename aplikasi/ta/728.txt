Abstract. The governing equations describing methane oxidation in a reverse 
flow reactor are given by a set of convective-diffusion equations with a nonlinear 
reaction term, where temperature and methane conversion are dependent 
variables. In this study, the process is assumed to be a one-dimensional pseudo-
homogeneous model and takes place with a certain reaction rate in which 
thewhole process ofthereactor is still workable. Thus, the reaction rate can 
proceed at a fixed temperature. Under these conditions, we can restrict ourselves 
to solving the equations for the conversion only. From the available data, it turns 
out that the ratio of the diffusion term to the reaction term is small. Hence, this 
ratio is considered as a small parameter in our model and this leads to a singular 
perturbation problem. Numerical difficulties will be found in the vicinity of a 
small parameter in front of a higher order term. Here, we present an analytical 
solutionby means of matched asymptotic expansions. The result shows that, up 
to and including the first order of approximation, the solution is in agreement 
with the exact and numerical solutions of the boundary value problem. 
Keywords: asymptotic analysis; boundary layer; methane oxidation process; pseudo 
homogeneous; reverse flow reactor; steady state conversion. 
1 Introduction 
Methane as a greenhouse gas has a warming potential twenty three times greater 
than that of carbon dioxide, so removing it is important for environmental 
reasons. Furthermore, methane is a valuable energy source, so that an efficient 
conversion of methane to carbon dioxide would be doubly advantageous. This 
can be achieved by feeding oxygen and methane into a reactor. A catalyst is 
276 Aang Nuryaman, et al. 
required to accelerate the conversion and normally preheating would be 
required to achieve optimal conversion conditions, however, by using the heat 
output from the reaction and appropriate cooling, preheating can be avoided and 
optimal chemical conversion conditions can be realized. 
A concept successfully used in methane combustion is the catalytic reverse flow 
reactor (RFR). This concept was first discussed by Frank-Kamenetski [1] and 
was reviewed by Matros and Bunimovich [2]. An RFR is a packed-bed reactor 
in which the flow direction is periodically reversed totrap a hot zone within the 
reactor. 
The common features of the combustion process in an RFR are usually the 
reaction-convection-diffusion equations with time-periodic coefficients and 
time-periodic boundary conditions. Garg, et al. [3] have observed that an 
adiabatic operation leads to periodic, period-1 symmetric states at which the 
temperature and concentrationprofiles at the beginning and end of a flow-
reversal period are mirror images. 
Earlier studies [4-10] mostly focused on the determination of the steady state 
temperature profile within the reactor. The simulation of Gosiewski and 
Warmuzinsky [5] showed that the heat recovery by hot gas withdrawal from the 
reactor guaranteed more favorable symmetry of the half-cycle-temperature 
profile. For a cooled RFR, Khinast and Luss [8] observed that if reactor cooling 
was increased, the symmetric temperature profile became unstable and either a 
periodic asymmetric, a quasi-periodic or a chaotic state was obtained. Salomon, 
et al. [11] pointed out that the radial temperature gradient exists in both the inert 
and catalytic sections.  
In this paper, we will discuss the steady state solution of the conversionof 
methane oxidation in an RFR in only one direction, from the left to the right 
end. We assume that the model is one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous with 
small temperature variations and no heat loss. This leads to an equation in terms 
of the conversion variable only with an isothermal non linear reaction rate. For 
this case, the reaction can be considered to take place at a fixed temperature. 
Rescaling the variables, we obtain a dimensionless equation in which a small 
parameter is contained in the highest order of the equation,which leads to a 
singular perturbation problem. We solve the derived equation by using the 
matched asymptotic expansion method (see Holmes [12] orVerhulst [13]). 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a mathematical model for 
steady state conversion of methane is described. The full equations are written 
in the Appendix. In Section 3, the asymptotic analysis using the singular

perturbation techniqueis presented to find the solution of steady state 
conversion. The conclusions are written in the last section. 
2 Mathematical Model 
In our study, we consider a cooled RFR described by a one-dimensionalpseudo-
homogeneous model that is taken from van Noorden [14], (see the detailed 
explanation in the Appendix). In the steady state, namely 0?t? , the resulting 
conversion equation is given by

asymptotic solution for the system (3)-(4). 
3 Asymptotic Solution 
For 0?? , (3) has two linearly independent solutions.However for 0?? , (3) 
becomes a singular perturbation problem since we have a reduced order of the 
equation. To find the (outer) solution, we replace ? ?x? by ? ? ? ? ...10 ?? xyxy ? , 
and get for ? ?1O  of (3)-(4) the following equations 
 ? ? ? ? 01',00       ,01 000 ???? yyy  (5) 
with the general solution 
 ? ? 10 ?? xyouter? . (6) 
278 Aang Nuryaman, et al. 
It is clear that (6) cannot fulfill the left boundary condition in (4). Thus, we end 
up with a boundary layer problem. To find the inner solution, we assume that 
there is a boundary layer at 0?x . Let

The correct balancing in (11) occurs if ?? ??? 123 or 01 ??? , which

The general solution of this problem is 
 ? ? DCeY ?? ???0 , (13) 
where C and D are arbitrary constants. The boundary condition in (12) gives
0?D , thus (13) becomes 
 ? ? ??? CeY ?0 . (14) 
From (14), we recognize that for ??? ,  the solution tends to be unbounded, 
except for 0?C . Thus for 2?? , the inner solution ? ??0Y  is trivial and it is 
not an asymptotic solution we need.

In the second case, 1?? , the boundary-layer Eq. (11) becomes

and the solution is

Note that from the ? ?1O  equation for case 1?? the matching process between 
the outer and the inner solutionsis automatically satisfied, i.e. ? ? ? ?000 yY ?? . 
Hence, the composite solution for ? ?1O  is 
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ????? /000 11

For ? ??O , from (3)-(4) we get the outer solution is ? ? 01 ?xy and from (15)-
(16) the boundary layer equation is

Again, the matching process for ? ??O is automatically satisfied and then the 
composite solution is the inner solution ? ??1Y , as in (20). So the asymptotic 
solution for our problem up to and including ? ??O  is

The three term expansion of ?? 42 ? is considered since the roots 1r and 2r  in 
(22) contain a factor

We observe that the results of the asymptotic solution and the numerical 
simulations hardly differ. The effect of reducing the magnitude of ?  is to 
shorten the window of the rapid changes of the solution. 
4 Conclusion 
Based on available data,  we constructed a singular perturbation problem for the 
steady state conversion of the methane oxidation process in a reverse flow 
reactor. The small parameter in our problem occurred both in front of the 
convective and diffusive terms in which the order of the diffusive term is higher 
than the convective one. Also, one of the boundary conditions had an order 
between the orderof those terms. Using the matched asymptotic expansion 
method and assuming that the boundary layer occurs at 0?x ,  we solved the 
equation up to and including the first-order approximation. The present 
asymptotic solution was quite in agreement with the numerical solution and the 
exact solution.
