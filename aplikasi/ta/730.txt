Abstract. Phase transformation of rice husk ash in the synthesis of ZSM-5 
without organic template at various crystallization times has been studied. 
Zeolite has been synthesized using the hydrothermal method at 175 ÅãC with 
molar ratio 10Na2O : 100SiO2 : 2Al2O3 : 1800H2O with addition of silicalite-1 as 
seed. Solids were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR) 
spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Analysis of 
the results of XRD and IR spectroscopy indicated that ZSM-5 crystalstarted to 
form at 12 h of crystallization time, reaching high crystallinity after 24 h. With a 
crystallization time of more than 48 h, the ZSM-5 crystals had completely 
transformed into more stable quartz phase. Results indicated that phase 
transformation has occurred, in which an amorphous phase of rice husk ash has 
been  transformed to ZSM-5 crystal phase during the early crystallization stage 
and continued to transform to disordered Éø-cristobalite phase and lastly quartz 
phases. SEM showed that the morphology of the ZSM-5 crystal was of an 
irregular hexagonal shape with particle size distribution around 3-7 É m. 
Keywords: crystallization time; phase transformation; rice husk ash; template-free; 
ZSM-5. 
1 Introduction 
Rice is the main agricultural product in Indonesia and other agrarian countries. 
The milling of rice yield about 72% of rice, 5-8% of bran, and 20-22% of husk 
[1]. Although rice husk is an abundant by-product of rice milling, it is only used 
as material for burning bricks or just thrown away. Rice husk contains 20-22% 
ash and 78-80% volatile organic material (lignin, cellulose, sugar) [2]. 
Krishnarao, et al. [3] reported various ranges of rice husk ash (RHA), from 13 
to 29%, depending on the rice variety, climate and geographical location. The 
 Phase Transformation of Rice Husk Ash 251 
 
most common valuable component of rice husk ash is silica (SiO2), about 90-
98%, with a small amount of alkali and metal impurities. 
Silica is widely utilized in the fields of electronics, mechanics, arts, as well as 
the manufacture of chemical compounds, including the manufacture of zeolite. 
One zeolite, ZSM-5 (Zeolite Socony Mobile-5), is widely used as 
heterogeneous catalyst in the petroleum industry and for fine chemicals 
production. It is usually synthesized using commercial silica in the form of 
silica gel, silica sol and fumed amorphous silica. However, waste materials with 
a high silica content such as rice husk ash (RHA) or coal fly ash (CFA), are 
potential alternative silica sources for zeolite synthesis. 
Previous studies have shown that rice husk ash in amorphous and crystalline 
forms can be used as a source of silica for the synthesis of zeolite, either with or 
without templates [4-6]. Ramli and Bahruji [7] reported the synthesis of ZSM-5 
using rice husk ash as silica source with tetrapropylammonium (TPA) as an 
added organic template. Kim, et al. [8] and Cheng, et al. [9] reported the 
synthesis of nanosize ZSM-5 in the absence of an organic template with a fast 
crystallization time. The use of an organic template such as TPA in the 
synthesis of ZSM-5 means higher production costs, liquid waste contamination 
by the organic template, and possible air pollution from the product of thermal 
decomposition of the organic template. Therefore, it is preferable to synthesize 
the zeolite without organic templates [10-14].  
Budianto [15] has reported the synthesis of ZSM-5 from rice husk ash without 
organic template, by adding 1% of seed to help the crystallization process. The 
use of a seed crystal to help crystallization has also been reported by Weitkamp 
and Puppe [16] in the synthesis of the MFI type of zeolites. According to 
Vempati, et al. [17], the seed accelerated the crystallization process and 
improved the structure of the resulting ZSM-5.  
Although ZSM-5 was successfully synthesized from RHA without organic 
template, as reported by Budianto [15], no study has been done on the phase 
transformation of the solid sample during crystallization for a longer period of 
crystallization time. This work reports a study of the phase transformation of an 
amorphous gel mixture containing silica of rice husk ash during the synthesis of 
ZSM-5 without addition of an organic template. 
2 Experiment  
2.1 Materials Preparation 
The rice husk (obtained from Surabaya, East Java) was first washed with 
distilled water and then dried at 100 
o
C for 24 h before burning at 600 
o
C for 4 h 
252 Didik Prasetyoko, et al. 
in air. The resulted rice husk ash was characterized using XRD technique. 
Synthesis of ZSM-5 without organic template was done by the addition of a 
seed crystal. The reaction mixture contained NaOH (99wt%; Merck), sodium 
aluminate (technical grade, Al as Al2O3 50-56wt%, Na as Na2O 40-45wt%; 
Sigma Aldrich), rice husk ash (SiO2, 93wt%) and calcined silicalite-1 as seed 
crystal. The reaction mixture was prepared with molar composition: 10Na2O : 
100SiO2: 2Al2O3: 1800H2O. Initial silica and alumina mixtures were prepared 
separately in two teflon beakers, A and B. Beaker A contained a mixture of 
NaOH, water and rice husk ash, while beaker B contained sodium aluminates 
and water.  Both beakers were stirred for two h. The reaction mixture in beaker 
B was added to beaker A, and stirred for 6 h. The resulting gel mixture was 
aged for 12 h at room temperature before being transferred to a stainless steel 
autoclave. Then calcined silicalite-1 seed (1wt%), which was previously 
prepared in our laboratory [18] was added to the mixture. Subsequently, the 
mixture was heated at 175 
o
C with a variation of the crystallization times i.e. 6, 
12, 24, 48, and 96 h. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature to stop 
the crystallization process. The solid was filtered and washed with distilled 
water until the washing water became neutral. Finally, the solid was dried at 
110 
o
C for 12 h. and characterized with XRD, FT-IR spectroscopy and SEM 
techniques. 
2.2 Characterization 
The phase of the samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (Philips PN-1830 
X-ray Diffractometer) using Ni-filtered CuKÉø radiation (É… = 1.5406 ?) at 40 kV 
and 40 mA. The pattern was scanned in the 2É∆ ranges 5-50? at a step size of 
0.010? and a step time of 1 s. The infrared spectra of the samples were recorded 
on a Shimadzu FTIR, with scans 20 s using the KBr pellet method, in the 
wavenumber range of 1400-400 cm
-1
. Scanning Electron Microscopy was 
monitored on a JEOL 6303 LA to determine the surface morphology of the 
samples. 
3 Results and Discussion  
The rice husk sample was burned at 600ÅãC and the as-synthesized solids at 
different crystallization times were characterized by X-ray diffraction technique 
in the range of 2É∆ = 5-50Åã, as shown in Figure 1. The XRD pattern of the rice 
husk ash sample (Figure 1(a)) shows a hump in the region 2É∆ = 15?30o. This 
indicates that the ash contains amorphous material [19,20].  
Figures 1(a-e) present the XRD patterns of the synthesized samples at various 
crystallization times. The XRD pattern of the sample crystallized for 6 h, 
(Figure 1(b)) also shows a hump at 2É∆ = 15-30?, indicating that the sample still 
 Phase Transformation of Rice Husk Ash 253 
 
contained amorphous material. This suggests that the sample had not yet been 
converted to zeolite phase. We have reported earlier that the transformation of 
rice husk ash involves the dissolution of silica ash in the early stages of 
crystallization [6]. 
The XRD pattern of the sample crystallized for 12 h (Figure 1(c)) shows a very 
small peak at 2É∆ = 22.97? indicating an early formation of ZSM-5 crystal [21]. 
However, the sample still contained amorphous material as the hump still 
appeared in the diffractogram of the sample. Meanwhile, the sample crystallized 
for 24 h (Figure 1(d)) shows full crystal phase with diffraction peaks at 2É∆ 7.88, 
22.97, 23.23, 23.63, 23.85 and 24.33?. This XRD pattern matches well with the 
XRD of reference of ZSM-5 [21], indicating that ZSM-5 type zeolite has been 
formed. The XRD pattern of the sample shows a high intensity of the signal 
with the absence of a hump, suggesting that only ZSM-5 crystal is present in the 
sample, with good crystallinity. 
Figure 1(e-g) show the XRD patterns of the samples that have been crystallized 
for 48, 72 and 96 h respectively. The XRD of the sample crystallized for 48 h 
(Figure 1(e)), shows additional peak at 2É∆ = 21.97?. This peak is assigned to the 
disordered Éø-cristobalite phase [21]. The intensity of the highest peak 
characteristic for ZSM-5 at 2É∆ = 22.97? of this sample is lower than that of the 
peak of the sample crystallized for 24 h. This observation suggests that the 
crystallinity of ZSM-5 has decreased, while some of the ZSM-5 crystal phase 
has undergone dissolution. The silicate rich solution and the high alkali media 
of the reaction mixture that was used in this experiment havefacilitated the 
growth of disordered Éø-cristobalite, a type of silica crystal phase.  
With a prolonged crystallization time, several phase transformations were 
observed. The XRD pattern of the sample crystallized for 72 h is shown in 
Figure 1(f). All peak patterns for ZSM-5 phase have completely disappeared in 
this sample, with only two peaks at 2É∆ = 20.8 and 26.59?. The peaks match well 
with the quartz phase [21], which suggests that the ZSM-5 phase has completely 
transformed to the more stable quartz phase [21]. However, in the sample 
crystallized for 96 h, a reappearing of the ZSM-5 phase is visible in the XRD in 
Figure 1(g). The reappearing of a small peak at 2É∆ = 7.9 and 22.97 indicates that 
some quartz crystal has re-dissolved into the reaction mixture, while the 
available aluminate species in the reaction mixture have facilitated the 
reformation of ZSM-5 crystals. After 72 h of crystallization, the peak intensity 
of I100 at 2É∆ = 26.59? of quartz has decreased from 7111 cps in the sample 
crystallized for 72 h to 3493 cps in the sample crystallized for 96 h, which 
indicates the decrease crystallinity of the quartz phase (also shown in Figure 2).

 Phase Transformation of Rice Husk Ash 255 
 
All the findings indicate that phase transformations have occurred in the 
solid samples in which crystallization proceeded, from the amorphous phase 
of the aluminosilicate gel mixture to the ZSM-5 phase, continued to the 
disordered Éø-cristobalite phase, and to the more stable quartz phase. The 
transformation of the amorphous aluminosilicates gel to the crystalline 
phases is presented in Figure 2, showing a plot between the crystallization 
times versus the total intensity of each phase. On the basis of the XRD 
results, we can conclude that pure ZSM-5 can be obtained in 24 h 
crystallization time with the gel ratio used in this study and the help of seed 
crystals. In the reaction mixture used in this experiment, which was highly 
alkaline, and with the absence of an organic template as structure-directing 
agent, the formed ZSM-5 crystal is metastable and prone to re-dissolve and 
facilitate the formation of a more stable silica crystal such as quartz, with a 
prolonged crystallization time. Different findings of silica transformation 
were also reported by Barrer [22] in at different system solution at high 
temperature, where the transformation of amorphous silica followed the 
sequence: amorphous Å® Éø-cristobalite Å® keatite Å® quartz.  
Assuming the ZSM-5 phase in the sample crystallized for 24 h to 100%, the 
relative crystallinity of the ZSM-5 phase formed in samples at 12, 24, 48, 72 
and 96 h crystallization time have been calculated, the results are shown in 
Table 1. The difference in intensity observed in the XRD patterns is due to 
the difference in crystallinity of the ZSM-5 samples, which can also 
indicates the amount of ZSM-5 contained in the solid sample.

Figure 2 Transformation of amorphous silica to ZSM-5, disordered Éø-
cristobalite and quartz phase.  
The infrared spectra of the rice husk ash and the samples at various 
crystallization times were recorded at wavenumber in the range of 1400-400 
cm
-1
 as shown in Figure 3, the wavenumbers of each peak are tabulated in Table 
2. The infrared spectrum of the rice husk ash in Figure 3(a) shows the 
characteristics of the asymmetric stretching of the tetrahedral SiO4 peaks at 
wavenumber 1099 cm
-1
, the symmetry stretching of SiO4 at ca. 799 cm
-1
 and the 
bending of Si-O at 467 cm
-1
 [23,24]. The third peak of the rice husk ash 
spectrum, at 467 cm
-1
, indicates that the rice husk ash is in the form of 
amorphous phase [25]. Figure 3(b) and (c) represent the infrared spectra of the 
solid samples crystallized for 6 and 12 h respectively. The spectra of these 
samples appear almost the same as the spectrum of the rice husk ash. This 
indicates that the ZSM-5 crystal has not yet been formed in these samples, 
which agrees well with the XRD finding. 
The infrared spectrum of the sample crystallized for 24 h (Figure 3(d)) shows a 
vibrational peaks pattern in the ZSM-5 framework. Peaks at around 1102, 796 
and 456 cm
-1
 are characteristic for the asymmetric stretching of the tetrahedral 
TO4 (T=Si,Al) and the T-O bending, respectively. The appearance of a shoulder 
peak at 1218 cm
-1
, which is assigned to the asymmetric stretching of the 
external framework and at 542 cm
-1
, which is assigned to five-membered ring 
vibration, are characteristic for an MFI zeolite framework, ZSM-5 belongs to 
this group of zeolite [25, 26]. These two vibrational peaks are sensitive to the

framework changes while the appearance of five-membered ring vibration at 
542 cm
-1 
confirms the ZSM-5 structure because the ZSM-5 framework structure 
is made of such 5-membered rings of TO4 tetrahedral building units. The IR 
spectrum of the sample supports the data from the XRD. The spectrum is also in 
accordance with the result reported by Flanigen, et al. [23], and also with the 
spectrum of ZSM-5 synthesized from commercial silica (tetraethylorthosilicate, 
TEOS) in the presence of an organic template (tetrapropyl ammonium bromide, 
TPABr) as is shown in Figure 3(h). 
The sample crystallized for 48 h had a similar infrared pattern (Figure 3(e)) to 
the infrared spectrum of the sample crystallized for 24 h, which indicates that 
the sample still maintained the ZSM-5 structure. However the peaks that are 
sensitive to the structure change in ZSM-5 (ca. 1218 and 542 cm
-1
) started to 
decrease in intensity and disappeared in samples crystallized for longer than 48 
h (Figure 3(f and g)). This observation agrees well with the XRD results in 
which there samples consist of quartz as the dominant phase. By looking at the 
asymmetric stretching peak for the samples crystallized for 24 and 48 h, both of 
which consist of ZSM-5 phase, the sample crystallized for 24 h is suggested to 
be more siliceous than the sample crystallized for 48 h because the peak appears 
at a higher frequency, i.e. at 1102 cm
-1
 rather than 1096 cm
-1
. This means that 
the sample crystallized for 24 h contains more silica due to the substitution of 
aluminium atoms with silicon atoms in the framework. According to Armaroli, 
et al. [27], the ZSM-5 with high aluminum content shows an asymmetric 
stretching band at around 1090 cm
-1
.

 Phase Transformation of Rice Husk Ash 259 
 
The SEM of the rice husk ash sample crystallized for 24 h, and the ZSM-5 
synthesized using TEOS and organic template TPABr are shown in Figure 4. 
The morphology of the rice husk ash appears as aggregates in various size 
around 50-100 É m with no definite structure, suggesting the presence of 
amorphous material. Some flaky layers with a needle-like structure can be 
observed at the aggregate particle (Figure 4(a)). The flaky morphology of the 
sample of amorphous silica aggregates, as seen in the SEM images, shows a 
reactive surface that can easily make bonds [19]. The morphology of the sample 
crystallized for 24 h is shown in Figure 4(b). In general, this sample displays an 
almost uniform, grubby, hexagonal like crystal, spread evenly with a varying 
particle size, ranging between 1-5 É m. For comparison, the morphology of the 
ZSM-5 synthesized using TEOS as silicon source and TPABr is shown in 
Figure 4(c). It can be observed that the morphology of the crystals consists of 
layers of agglomerated hexagonal crystal-shapes resulting in a much larger 
crystal, with an average size of 20 É m as compared to 5 É m for the ZSM-5 
synthesized from rice husk ash.

4 Conclusion  
Pure ZSM-5 with a particle size between 3-7 É m can be synthesized from rice 
husk ash as silica source within 24 h of crystallization time without an organic 
template and with the addition of silicalite-1 as seed crystal. The ZSM-5 phase 
started to form after 12 h of hydrothermal crystallization and reached maximum 
crystallinity and purity at 24 h of crystallization. The ZSM-5 crystal formed is 
metastable since with a longer crystallization time the ZSM-5 crystal was 
transformed into the more stable quartz phase.
