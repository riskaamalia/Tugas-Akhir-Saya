Abstract. In this paper, we study the instability properties of solutions of a kind 
of functional differential equations of the fifth order with constant delay. Using 
the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, we obtain certain sufficient 
conditions to guarantee that the zero solution of the equation is unstable. 
Keywords: fifth order; functional differential equation; instability; Lyapunov-
Krasovskii functional. 
1 Introduction 
It is well known that the instability of the solutions is a very important problem 
in the theory and applications of differential equations. For example, if the 
solutions of a differential equation describing a dynamical system or of any 
differential equation under consideration are known in closed form, then one 
can determine the instability properties of the system or the solutions of the 
differential equation taken under consideration, appealing directly the definition 
of the instability, which will be introduced hereinafter. In addition, ideally, one 
would like to compute clearly all solutions of every differential equation or 
system of differential equations. However, as we know, there are actually very 
few equations (beyond linear equations with constant coefficients ? and even 
there are difficulties if the order of the equation or system is high) for which we 
can do this. That is, in general, it is not possible to find the solution of all linear 
and nonlinear differential equations, except numerically. Moreover, finding 
solutions becomes more difficult for delay differential equations rather than 
differential equations without delay. Therefore, it is very important to get 
information about the qualitative behavior of solutions of delay differential 
equations when there is no analytical expression for the solutions. In the 
literature, specific methods have been developed to obtain information on the 
qualitative behavior of solutions of differential equations when there is no 
analytical expression for the solutions. One of them is known as LyapunovÅfs 
second (or direct) method. More than 100 years ago, the world-famous 
mathematician Lyapunov established this method to study stability problems. 
Today, this method is widely recognized as an excellent tool not only in the 
240 Cemil Tun?  
study of differential equations but also in the theory of control systems, 
dynamical systems, system with time lag, power system analysis, and so on. It 
is worth mentioning that the expressions of Lyapunov functionals are very 
complicated and hard to construct. The method is an interesting and fruitful 
technique to determine the instability and the stability behaviors of solutions of 
linear and non-linear differential equations. This technique has gained 
increasing significance and has given impetus for modern development of 
instability and stability theory of differential equations. An apparent advantage 
of this method is that the instability and the stability in the large can be obtained 
without any prior knowledge of solutions. That is, the method yields instability 
and stability information directly, without solving the differential equation. The 
chief characteristic of the method requires the construction of the scalar 
function or functional for the equation under study. Unfortunately, it is 
sometimes very difficult to find a proper Lyapunov function or functional for a 
given differential equation. 
However, from then on, the LyapunovÅfs direct method was also widely used 
and is still being employed to study the instability of solutions of ordinary 
differential equations and functional differential equations of fifth order, see e.g. 
Tun? [1-10], Li and Duan [11], Ezeilo [12-14], Li and Yu [15], Sadek [16], Sun 
and Hou [17], Tiryaki [18], Tun? and Erdogan [19], Tun? and Karta [20], and 
Tun? and ?evli [21]  and the references therein. Besides, it is worth mentioning 
that to the best of our knowledge, the instability of the solutions of certain 
functional differential equations of the fifth order has been discussed in the 
literature, recently (see  [1-7]).  
In this case, it is worthwhile to continue the investigation of the instability of 
the solutions of functional differential equations of fifth order.  
It should be noted that the author in ([1,2,5,6]) considered the functional 
differential equations of the fifth order

the zero solution of these equations is unstable by defining some appropriate 
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals.

By using the ?etaevÅfs instability theorem, they obtained sufficient conditions 
for the zero solution of Eq. (1) to be unstable, see LaSalle and Lefschetz [22]. 
In this paper, instead of Eq. (1), we consider fifth order nonlinear delay 
differential equation

where ,5a  4a  and )0( ?r   are  constants, r  is fixed delay, the primes in Eq. 
(2) denote differentiation with respect to  ,t );,0[ ???? ?t   ,1f 2f  
and 3f   
are continuous functions on ,? 5?  and ,
5?  respectively, and with .0)0(1 ?f  
The continuity of the functions ,1f 2f  
and 3f   is a sufficient condition for the 
existence of the solution of Eq. (2) (see [23, pp.14]). It is also assumed as basic 
that the functions ,1f 2f  
and 3f  satisfy a Lipschitz condition in their respective 
arguments. Hence, the uniqueness of the solutions of Eq. (2) is guaranteed (see 
[23, pp.15]). We also assume throughout what follows that 1f  is differentiable, 
and )(),...,( 51 txtx   
are abbreviated as ,,..., 51 xx   respectively.  
It should also be noted that, in reality, many systems have the property of 
aftereffect, i.e. the future states depend not only on the present, but also on the 
past. Therefore, the investigation of the instability of the solutions of delay 
differential equations of higher order is very considerable in the literature. The 
purpose of this paper is to present a new result on the instability of the zero 
solution of Eq. (2). Our method relies on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional 
approach (see [24]). This method permits us to obtain a new result on Eq. (2) 
under quite general assumptions on the nonlinearities. The obtained result 
improves and enhances the result in Li and Duan [11, Theorem 5] for the case 
without delay to the case with delay. Here, by defining an appropriate 
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, we carry out our purpose. It should be noted 
that the result to be established here is different from that in Tun? ([1], [2], [5], 
[6]) and the literature. 
It is worth mentioning that for some recent works on the qualitative behaviors 
of solutions, we can also refer to Zhu and Shong [25] and Zhu, et al. [26]. 
In the following theorems, we give a basic idea of the method about the 
instability of solutions of ordinary and delay differential equations. The 
following theorem is due to the Russian mathematician N.G. ?etaev (see 
LaSalle and Lefschetz [22]). 
Theorem A (Instability Theorem of ?etaev).

and region 1?

1. ( )V x  has continuous first partial derivatives in 1.?  
2. ( )V x  and ( )V x?   are  positive in

Under these conditions the origin is unstable.

2 Statement of Main Result 
In this section, we will state our main result. The main result is the following 
theorem. 
244 Cemil Tun?

following conditions hold:

then the zero solution of Eq. (2) is unstable. 
Remark.  It is clear that Eq. (2) has the zero solution since .0)0(1 ?f  
It should be noted that the proof of the main result is based on the instability 
criteria of Krasovski? [24]. Because of these criteria, it is necessary to show here 
that there exists a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional ),...,( 51 tt xxVV ?  that has 
Krasovskii properties, say ),( 1P )( 2P  and :)( 3P

to the conditions of the theorem, which now follows. By the above discussion, 
we can conclude that the zero solution of Eq. (2) is unstable. The proof for the 
theorem is complete. 
3 Conclusion 
A non-linear functional differential equation of fifth order with constant delay is 
considered. Based on the Krasovskii properties, the instability of the zero 
solution of this equation is discussed. In proving our result, we employ the 
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach by defining a new Lyapunov-
Krasovskii functional. Our result improves some known results from the scalar 
case to the vectorial case.
