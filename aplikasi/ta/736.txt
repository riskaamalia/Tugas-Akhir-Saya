Abstract. In this study, we have conducted a crosshole tomography survey to 
obtain seismic data from two boreholes on the ITB campus. The first borehole 
was 39 meters deep while the second was 19 meters deep. The aim of the study 
was to determine the subsurface velocity and Q-factor for the region between the 
two boreholes for geotechnical purposes. Sources of seismic waves were 
produced by an impulse generator and sparker and were recorded by 12 channels 
of borehole hydrophones. In the tomography inversion, the pseudo-bending ray 
tracing method was employed to calculate travel times. The initial velocity 
model was a 1-D model with 1x1 m
2
 block dimensions. The non-linear inversion 
problem was solved by delay-time tomography with the LSQR method. Also, a 
checkerboard resolution test (CRT) was conducted to evaluate the resolution of 
the tomography inversion. Using the velocity structure results, a LSQR Q-
tomography inversion was carried out using spectral curve fitting to obtain the 
attenuation structure (t* values). The resulting tomogram shows that there are 3 
layers, with an unconsolidated layer (down to 8 meters), a consolidated layer 
(from 8 meters deep to 20 meters), and bedrock (more than 20 meters). From the 
results, the ground water level is estimated at a depth of 14 meters. 
Keywords: crosshole tomography; Q-factor; ray tracing; subsurface velocity; travel 
time tomography.  
1 Introduction 
Crosshole tomography is a method to image the subsurface structure between 
two boreholes. The method is often employed for geotechnics and mineral 
exploration. In this study, crosshole tomography was used to image the depth of 
bedrock and ground water level.   
The physical properties obtained from this method are seismic wave velocity 
and attenuation factor. Both physical properties can be used to determine depth 
of bedrock and ground water level.

This study was conducted on the main campus of Institut Teknologi Bandung 
(ITB), Indonesia. Two boreholes were used,  LB1 and LB2, which were 19.8 
meters apart (see Figure 1).

2 Methodology 
2.1 Ray Tracing 
Ray tracing is a method to reconstruct rays from a source to a receiver. The 
algorithm used is the pseudo-bending method in which the algorithm is 
employed to minimize the travel time. This obeys Fermatfs principle, which 
states that the wave propagates with minimum travel time (see Figure 2).

velocity anomaly and diverge in the low-velocity anomaly.

2.2 Travel Time Tomography 
The travel time for direct wave T from a source i to a receiver j can be 
expressed using ray tracing as follows:  
 ??? =  ? ? ,? ??,
????????
??????
 (1) 
where: ?(? ,?) is the slowness (reciprocal of velocity), which is a function of 
position ds is the length of ray element.  
Travel time  ??? , can be written as follows:  
??? = ?? + ??? , (2) 
In this study, starting time ??  was 0 since we used active sources with known 
origin times. As a result, the arrival time was similar to the travel time. Ray path 
and slowness are parameters in the tomography inversion. However, both 
parameters are unknown.  
The solution for a tomography inversion is a non-linear problem. The delay-
time method can be used to solve iteratively the linearized approximation [1].  
The norm and gradient are also utilized to obtain a block solution without a ray 
and smoothing model. The flow chart of the delay-time method can be seen in 
Figure 3.

32 Fatkhan, et al. 
The tomographic matrix equation can be written as follows: 
  
?
??
??
 ?? =   
??
0
0
 , (3) 
 ?? = ???? ? ????? , (4) 
where A is the length of the ray in each block,  ƒ¿I is norm damping and, ƒÁG is 
gradient damping. ƒ¢m is the  slowness perturbation and ƒ¢t  is the delay time.      
 ??+1 = ?? +  ??  (5) 
Iterations stop when RMS becomes small and convergent. 
2.3 Attenuation Tomography 
The attenuation value of a medium is the inverse of the quality factor (Q), that is 
the ability of a medium to pass elastic wave energy [2]. The t* value is the 
attenuation parameter. In this study, t* was estimated from the equation, 
 ?? =
?
?
, (6) 
where t is travel time and Q is the quality factor. 
High dynamic range analysis of spectral waveforms was employed to calculate 
the t* value. An approximation by Eberhart-Phillips and Chadwick [3] was used 
to determine the velocity spectrum and t* inversion. Assuming an f
2
 source 
model [4], velocity spectral amplitudes from source i to station j can be 
expressed as follows:   
 ???  ? = 2???0
??

?  , (7) 
 
where t*ij is the attenuation along the path. The three unknown parameters are 
corner frequency (fc), low frequency spectral level (ƒ¶0), and attenuation 
operator (t*), which can be calculated using spectral-fitting. 
t* is the travel time divided by the quality factor and can be written as the 
integration along the ray path from a source to a station, i.e. [5], [6], and [7].

3 Data Acquisition and Processing  
3.1 Equipment 
In this study a sparker was used as the source of seismic P-waves generated by 
an impulse generator (IPG 1005). Seismic waves were recorded by a string of 
hydrophones, type-III with 12 channels. A sample rate of 50 ƒÊs was used with a 
record length of 51.2 ms and 200 ƒÊs with a length of 204.8 ms. 
3.2 Borehole Scheme 
The distance between the two boreholes was 19.80 meters. The depth of the first 
borehole (LB1) was more than 39 meters, while the second borehole (LB2) was 
19 meters deep. LB1 was used for the sources and LB2 was used for the 
receivers. The sources were exploded from depths of 17 to 39 meters at 1 meter 
intervals. The receivers were located at depths of 1 meter to 19 meters with 1 
meter intervals (see Figure 5).

positions. Model parameterization uses a grid with size of 1x1 m

3.3 Data Preparation 
Field records were arranged according to common sources. Figure 6 shows the 
common source data after noise correction.    
 
Figure 6 Common Source 28-1 filtered with tube wave. The tube wave 
propagates along a fluid-filled well. Therefore it was affected by responses of 
geophones as  noises. Later on, we filtered the waveform data to reduce the 
influence of noise.

3.4 Picking First Break 
For picking the first break of the P-waves, the  Akaike Information Criterion 
(AIC) method was used. Subsequently, the results were organized into catalog 
data (see Figure 7).

AIC method, which is based on the variance data, can distinguish the arrival time 
clearly. 
4 Results 
4.1 Model Parameterization 
Model parameterization used homogeneous blocks with a size of 1x1 m
2
 with 
20 blocks horizontally and 39 blocks vertically.  
36 Fatkhan, et al. 
4.2 Initial Velocity 
The initial velocity was obtained from a 1-D tomography with the gradient 
velocity as a function of depth that can be expressed as follows:   
 ?(?) =  ?0 + ??  (9) 
where V(z) is the velocity at depth z, V0 is the first layer velocity, and k is the 
velocity factor gradient.  
In the study, V0 =  500 m/s and the velocity gradient k = 50.6 m/s. Results from 
the 1-D tomography are shown in Figure 8, which was used as the initial model.

4.3 Checkerboard Resolution Test 
The Checkerboard Resolution Test (CRT) is forward modelling employed to 
test the reliability of an inversion method. The results of this test show that there 
was good resolution when a cell was passed by many ray paths (see Figure 9).

results for the velocity. (c) Inversion results for Q-tomography. Both the velocity 
and Q  inversions show that there is an unconsolidated layer (down to 8 meters), 
a consolidated layer (from 8 meters down to 20 meters), and bedrock ( > 20 
meters).

5 Conclusions 
The tomographic inversion results for both the velocity and attenuation show 
that there are three rock layers: an unconsolidated layer (down to depth of 8 
meters), a consolidated layer (from 8 to 20 meters in depth), and bedrock ( > 20 
meters in depth).  
It is estimated that the water table is at a depth of 14 meters. 
The results of the Q tomographic inversion can be used to identify a water 
saturated zone that corresponds to a low-quality factor.
