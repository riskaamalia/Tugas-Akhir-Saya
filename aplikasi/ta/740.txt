Abstract. In this work we have investigated mixing in a modified orbiting screw 
mixer (MOSM) designed for solid-solid mixing. Mixing was carried out using 
urea powder and natural zeolite powder (UZ) of three varying particle sizes (50-
60, 60-80 and 80 mesh). Power consumption was calculated from the measured 
torque of orbit and screw, obtained from computerized records. It was found that 
the mixing process in the modified orbiting screw mixer with air injection 
required a lower power consumption for each particle-size group when compared 
to mixing without air injection. With UZ mixing in MOSM with air injection, the 
lowest E was obtained for the 60-80 mesh particle-size group (4,297 Joule/kg-1), 
whereas when mixing without air injection, the value was 10,296 J/kg. The best 
mixing operation in this experiment was achieved at NFr = 1.18x10
-3 and in the 
range of values NRe ? 8.77x10
7 to 2.63x108. Moreover, in this study, we have 
developed an equation to estimate the power consumption required for mixing 
and determined its correlation with dimensionless numbers. 
Keywords: air injection; modified orbiting screw mixer; power consumption; power

1 Introduction 
Mixing is an important process that is performed before granulation in order to 
achieve bulk homogeneity. Mixing and agitating vessels are widely used in the 
chemical, biochemical, food and other industries. Mixing urea and zeolite 
powder for the manufacture of SRF (Slow Release Fertilizers) aims to reduce 
the loss of urea due to its high solubility. In addition to increasing the efficiency 
of urea usage, natural zeolite employed as the matrix can serve as a conditioner. 
Natural materials, such as zeolite or clay, are attractive for use as a matrix. The 
development of SRF using clay has previously been explored, as clay is 
288 Semuel Pati Senda, et.al. 
abundant in various regions in Indonesia. However, recently zeolite has come 
up as an alternative matrix. The natural properties of zeolite give it advantages 
when used as a matrix support, including its good hygroscopic properties, large 
surface area, high action exchange capacity and capability (CEC) and good 
adsorption-desorption ability. 
Power consumption is the most important parameter to use for estimating 
mixing performance. To estimate the power consumption, a power correlation 
was developed for an orbiting screw mixer. The correlation of power 
consumption to particle size variations for the mixing of powdered urea-natural 
zeolite has not been previously reported. For paddle impellers in spherical and 
cylindrical agitated vessels, a new correlation of power consumption has been 
developed [1-2], which is more accurate than NagataÅfs correlation [3]. 
However, the new correlation cannot calculate the power consumption of other 
types of stirrers, such as the orbiting screw. Specifically mixing powdered urea-
natural zeolite with particle size variations no one has reported to date. 
Orbiting screws are used for mixing cohesive solids, and this type of screw is 
widely used in vessels ranging in size from portable to large tanks. Currently, 
there are no correlations for this type of stirrer. Therefore, we have developed a 
new correlation of power consumption for the orbiting screw. An orbiting screw 
mixer consists of a vessel in which the screw travels around the wall of the cone 
as it simultaneously rotates around its own axis, setting up strong circulation 
currents throughout the powder. A performance characteristic that must be 
considered in any mixing process is the power requirement, as sufficient power 
must be provided during the mixing process [4]. The power consumption 
required for the mixing process is one of the most important factors affecting 
the cost of the process. Therefore, energy consumption is expected to be as low 
as possible. The difference in density of the components that will be mixed may 
increase both the mixing time and power consumption. Denser material will 
sink through less dense material, leaving less dense particles on top [5]. If 
denser particles are present in the lower layer at the start of the mixing, the 
degree of mixing will increase gradually until equilibrium is attained. If denser 
particles are present in the upper layer, the denser components fall through the 
lighter components, leading to segregation instead of mixing.  
In this study, orbital and rotation speeds of the screw were varied in 
combination with the air flow rate, and their effects on mixing with three 
particle-size groups were investigated. The decreased power consumption of the 
mixing process results from the decreased load torque caused by the intrusion of 
air between the grains, creating a gap that reduces friction loss. Load friction 
may occur between particles, between particles and the chamber wall, and 
between particles and the surface of the screw mixer. An air flow rate that is too 
 The Power Consumption Performance 289 
 
low will not be effective because the air will not penetrate the gap; a flow rate 
that is too high will also be ineffective because the air flow through the middle 
of the chamber is not served by the screw mixer. This is due to the dome-shaped 
profile of the material surface, ensuring that the center makes the smallest 
obstacles go through the air. Thus, there is a correlation between the size of the 
particles and the optimum air flow rate, which decreases the power consumption 
of the mixing. 
The aim of this work was to examine the influence of rotation and orbital 
velocity, particle size and velocity of air flow on the power consumption of 
mixing urea-natural zeolite powder. The results will allow an estimation of the 
power required to rotate the screw and orbit at a specified speed, and determine 
the lowest energy-consuming configuration of the screw agitator. The criterion 
for selection was the mixing energy. The interaction between the power 
consumption, the mixing time and the geometric parameters of the orbiting 
screw mixer was also investigated.  
The performances of the mixing process are quantified by the specific energy E, 
mechanical power Wm, the electrical power Wl and torque É—m. The involved 
mixing operational parameters are  mass of solid m, angular velocity É÷r mixing 
power Pm, mixing time tmx, rotational speed N, electrical voltage V and current 
I.  Those variables are defined as follows 
 E = (? xPm x tmx)/m, (1) 
 Wm = É—m x N (2) 
 Wl= V x I] (3) 
 É—m = F x L (4) 
2 Experiment  
A schematic diagram of the orbiting screw mixer used in this work was adapted 
from the typically used powder mixer in the pharmaceutical industry. The size 
of this mixer was scaled-down to 1:10 with an effective height of 6 m (Figure 
1). The mixerÅfs wall was made of flexi glass. The conical diameter at the top 
and the bottom of the mixer was 50-600 mm and 100 mm, respectively. The 
angle of the screw conveyor from the vertical axis was approximately 18Åã. The 
mixer used a three-phase motor as the driver, with a speed range of 150-600 
rpm. The mixer was equipped with a gear reducer and a speed controller.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus. 
To minimize the occurrence of segregation, mixtures weighing 16 kg with a 1:1 
ratio of urea to zeolite with the same particle sizes were mixed in the vessel. 
The orbital and rotation speed should be sufficient to ensure homogeneity. From 
visual observation, the position of the zeolite at the lower part resulted in a 
better mixing performance compared to positioning it within the upper part. The 
experiment was conducted for orbital speeds of 5, 10, and 15 rpm and rotation 
speeds of 30, 50, and 67.5 rpm to achieve effective material movement within 
the bulk mass. Therefore, these speeds were selected for further tests. Based on 
previous experiments for batch mixing, the mixings were conducted for 15 
minutes [4]. The mixing experiments were performed in duplicate throughout 
the study. 
Data acquisition in the system was carried out using an instrumentation device 
and data acquisition program. The data obtained were torque transferred to the 
computer program by radio transmission. Figure 1 depicts the design layout of 
the equipment for the mixing experiments and data acquisition. This system has 
the capability to record data for time intervals in seconds. The data on the test

the screw axis of the orbit. 
Sensors were used to measure the strain-gage torque. Load measurements were 
conducted during the mixing process, so the use of radio transmission was 
necessary to send the data to the computer. Velocity measurements were 
performed using a proximity sensor. The data were processed first with a micro-
controller during data acquisition. Samples were taken manually from a specific 
point at the top of the mixtures every 24 seconds during the mixing process. 
After the mixing process ended, samples were also taken from different heights 
within the conical chamber. 
3 Results and Discussion 
Mixing urea-natural zeolite powder using a modified orbiting screw mixer with 
three particle-size groups (50-60, 60-80 and 80 mesh) with variations in rotation 
and orbital speeds has been previously conducted and evaluated [6]. It was 
reported that the lowest energy consumption is obtained at an orbital speed of 5 
rpm, a rotation speed of 50 rpm, and a particle size of 50-60 mesh. 
3.1 The Effect of Particle Size on Power Consumption 
Figures 2, 3 and 4 show that the power consumption for mixing with the three 
particle sizes, 50-60 mesh, 60-80 mesh and 80 mesh, without air injection was 
higher than that with air injection. These figures show that the power 
consumption for the 60-80 mesh particle size tended to decrease, except for the 
orbital speed of 10 rpm. At this speed, the power consumption tended to 
increase upon increasing the rotation speed. For the 80 mesh particle size, the 
power consumption also tended to increase, except for the orbital speed of 15 
rpm. At a constant orbital speed, a higher rotation speed yields a higher power 
consumption. Likewise, a higher rotation speed gives a higher power 
consumption.  
These figures also demonstrate the effects of air injection on power 
consumption for the various particle sizes. Figure 2 shows that the energy 
consumption of mixing without air injection is higher when compared to mixing 
with air injection for all variations of air flow rate, except for the power 
fluctuation in the 50-60 mesh particle size at air flow rates of 5 and 10 l/min. 
 
 
292 Semuel Pati Senda, et.al. 
 
Figure 2 Power consumption for PS = 50-60 mesh at nr/no = 67.5/5 rpm. 
Figure 3 shows that the power consumption for mixing the 60-80 mesh particle 
size tended to decrease at air flow speeds of 10 and 15 l/min, but not at 5 l/min. 
At this lower speed, power consumption was almost constant over the mixing 
time. This result may be due to the air flow not being large enough to penetrate 
the gaps, so the mixture showed constant power consumption over the mixing 
time. 
 
Figure 3 Power consumption for 60-80 mesh PS at nr/no = 67.5/10 rpm. 
 The Power Consumption Performance 293 
 
For the 80 mesh particle size, the power consumption also tended to decrease 
until it reached a value of 150 watts at mixing times above 600 seconds, as 
shown in Figure 4. The mixing of the 80 mesh particle size with an air flow rate 
of 5 l/min showed a higher power consumption that is relatively constant until 
the mixing time reached 700 seconds. The largest decline in power consumption 
was observed when mixing the powdered urea-natural zeolite of 60-80 mesh at 
an air flow rate of 10 l/min. This air flow rate was very effective because of the 
flow through the gap around the screw mixer, reducing the burden of friction 
during stirring. Power consumption for UZ mixing with the 60-80 mesh particle 
size was 150 watt at an air flow rate of 10 l/min. 
At an air flow rate of 15 l/min, the air speed was too high to be able to lift or 
break through the center of the dome surface of the material. With the opening 
of a gap in the dome, the majority of the air will flow out, and air in cracks 
around the screw mixer will be reduced. This reduced amount of air will reduce 
the effectiveness of the stirring and thus increase the power consumption. An air 
flow rate of 5 l/min is not effective enough to reduce the friction that occurs in 
the tank. However, the 60-80 mesh particle size reduced the power consumption 
when compared with the 50-60 mesh particle size, because the smaller sizes are 
lighter. The power consumption for mixing the UZ 80 mesh particle size was 
168 watt at an air flow rate of 10 l/min.  
 
Figure 4 Power consumption for PS = 80 mesh at nr/no = 67.5/5 rpm. 
The mechanical requirements of the orbiting screw mixer established for 
operating performance demonstrate that an increased ratio of orbital and 
294 Semuel Pati Senda, et.al. 
rotation speed yielded increased power consumption for all particle sizes 
studied. 
3.2 Energy Consumption 
Energy consumption required for the mixing process is one of the most 
important factors affecting the process costs. Therefore, energy consumption is 
expected to be as low as possible. Figure 5 describes the specific energy 
consumption required for mixing the urea-natural zeolite powder at the three 
different particle size variations (50-60 mesh, 60-80 mesh, and 80 mesh). This 
figure shows that the specific energy consumption with air injection for particle 
sizes of 50-60 and 80 mesh was higher than that of the 60-80 mesh particles. 
Moreover, the specific energy consumption decreased as the air flow rate 
increased. As previously mentioned, fine particles are more cohesive than 
coarse particles, leading to a higher force required to break down aggregates 
formed during the mixing process. Therefore, the mixing time for fine particles 
is longer than that for coarse particles, and there is a trade-off between power 
consumption and mixing time. The optimum specific energy consumption is 
achieved by considering both of these parameters [6].  
 
 
Figure 5 Variation in specific energy consumption with air flow rate. 
Figure 5 also shows that for the three particle-size groups, the 60-80 mesh 
group has the lowest specific energy consumption given by the combination of 
an orbital speed of 5 rpm and a rotation speed of 67.5 rpm at an air flow rate of 
10 l/min. For the particle sizes of 50-60 and 80 mesh, the lowest values were 
 The Power Consumption Performance 295 
 
obtained by the combinations of an orbital speed of 5 rpm and a rotation speed 
of 50-60 rpm with an air flow rate of 15 l/min, and an orbital speed of 5 rpm 
and a rotation speed of 30 rpm with an air flow rate of 10 l/min, respectively. 
Among all the variations, the lowest specific energy consumptions was obtained 
by the combination of orbital and rotation speeds of 5 and 67.5 rpm and an air 
flow rate of 10 l/min with a 60-80 mesh particle size. 
Figure 6 shows that the optimum specific energy consumption was achieved 
using MOSM with the introduction of an air flow rate of 10 l/min. The 
application of air injection at the UZ in MOSM mixing can clearly reduce the 
specific energy consumption of the screw rotation speed at the air flow rate 
specified. Increasing the air flow rate causes an increase in the specific energy 
consumption. This is a good result, proving a hypothesis that has been 
previously assumed: that the application of air injection into the mixing process 
of urea-natural zeolite for the manufacture of SRF urea can reduce power 
consumption, resulting in lower production costs. It is recommended to 
implement this mixing system for further development at the scale of 
production.

optimum ratio of nr/no.  
3.3 Correlations of Power Number 
To predict the power consumption required in the mixing process for urea-
natural zeolite of varying particle sizes, we developed a power equation for the 
orbiting screw mixer used in this experiment. The geometry of the mixer is 
296 Semuel Pati Senda, et.al. 
defined in Figure 7. The developed model equations for the mixing 
performances are summarized in Table 1.

Power numbers are used to estimate the power needed to rotate and revolve a 
screw mixer. To investigate the effects of varying particle sizes on power 
consumption, the orbiting screw mixer was used for mixing urea and natural 
zeolite with three particle sizes, 50-60 mesh, 60-80 mesh and 80 mesh. The 
optimum specific energy consumption in the mixing process of urea-natural 
zeolite with air injection shown in Figures 5 and 6 can also be proven with and 
represented in the form of Total Power Numbers (shown in Figure 8); the 
lowest power number (1.6 x 10
8
) was obtained at an air flow rate of 10 l/min for 
the 60-80 mesh particle-size group.

Figure 9 Total Power Number with respect to the Reynolds Number, NRe. 
Examining the influence of air injection on the mixing process of UZ, we 
observed an increase in the Total Power Number with an increased air flow rate, 
as shown in Figure 8. The effect of the air flow rate is indicated by the high 
power number for an air flow rate of 5 l/min that decreased sharply when 
increasing the flow rate to 10 l/min. When flow rates were increased above 
10 l/min, the Total Power Number remained a fixed value.

Variations in the Total Power Number with NRe are shown in Figure 9 for the 
three different particle-size groups. The Total Tower Number for mixing urea-
natural zeolite with air injection shows that Npo,t decreased as NRe increased. 
Figure 10 shows the correlation for the Total Power Number, (Npo,t) and the 
Froude Number (NFr) which indicates that the optimum operating condition for 
mixing with the lowest specific energy consumption was achieved in mixing of 
the 60-80 mesh particle-size group with an air flow rate of 10 l/min. The NFr 
values obtained ranged between 0.73x10
-3
 and 107x10
-6
. These results 
confirmed the results of research conducted by Edward, et al. [7], who reported 
that mixing solids in an orbiting screw mixer generally operates at NFr<1.

 for a 60-80 mesh UZ particle size with a 
combination screw mixer and an air flow rate of 10 l/min. 
4 Conclusions 
The results of this study indicate that the methodology of combining an orbiting 
screw mixer and air injection for the analysis of power consumption is suitable 
for further process development and scale-up. A particularly good result with 
respect to power consumption is found for mixing the 60-80 mesh particle-size 
group with a stirrer combination of a screw mixer and air injection with a 
rotation speed of 67.5 rpm, orbital speed of 5 rpm and air flow rate of 10 l/min. 
Mixing with the lowest specific energy consumption shows that the best mixing 
is achieved in the range of NRe values from 8.77x10
7 
to 2.63x10
