Abstract. We have studied the preparation of organic-inorganic hybrid polymer 
precursors by sol-gel technique and their utilization for nanostructured optical 
components for photonic applications. The gel polymer precursors were prepared 
from siloxane modified by polymerizable acrylate groups, which can be 
processed further by photopolymerization process. Molecular structure 
characterizations by means of the FTIR measurements indicate the conversion of 
C=C bonds into C-C bonds after photopolymerization. This bond conversion 
produces high cross-linking between the organic and inorganic moieties, 
resulting in thermally stable and chemically resistant thin polymer layer which 
provide unique advantages of this material for particular optical/photonic 
applications. By employing laser interference technique, gratings with 
periodicity between 400-1000 nm have been successfully fabricated. Application 
of those sub-micron periodicity of grating structure as active elements in 
optically pumped polymer laser system and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) 
based measurement system have been also explored. The experimental results 
therefore also show the potential applications of this hybrid polymer as a 
building material for micro/nano-photonics components.  
Keywords: hybrid polymers; nano-optics; optically pumped polymer laser; pulsed 
laser interference; sol-gel materials; surface Plasmon resonance. 
1 Introduction 
Functional polymers have attracted much attention for various applications in 
conventional optics, micro/nano-optical components, such as photonic band gap 
(PBG) structure, and micro-electro-mechanic systems (MEMS) [1-6].Easiness 
in fabrication process, which commonly does not require high temperature, is 
one of the main advantages of polymers. Such processing condition allows the 
208 Rahmat Hidayat, et al. 
incorporation of various kinds of functional organic dyes. High temperature 
requirement in glass and ceramic processing prevents the incorporation of 
functional organic dyes, which will decompose a thigh temperature. Acrylic and 
epoxy polymers, such as poly(methylmetacrylate) (PMMA) and SU-8, are 
typical examples of polymers commonly used for those purposes, including 
modern optic applications, such as fiber optics, optical interconnect 
components, solid-state dye lasers, and optical amplifiers [1,2,7-9].However, 
some disadvantages related to optical transparency, thermal stability, chemical 
resistance and mechanical strength often restrict further development of their 
applications for functional optical and photonic components. 
In the last decade, organic-inorganic hybrid polymers, which are also called as 
Ormosils or ORMOCERs polymers, have been much investigated because of 
their interesting physical-chemical properties [10-14].These hybrid polymers 
are commonly made from silicon alkoxides that are modified with 
polymerizable organic groups, such as acrylic, methacrylic or epoxy, resulting 
in the formation of inorganic and organic cross-linked network. According to 
the classification given by Sanchez, these kinds of hybrid polymers are 
classified as Class II, where the organic and inorganic components are linked 
together by strong chemical bonds (covalent or ionic bonding) [10,11]. The 
inorganic network is formed by sol-gel process, which is adapted from the sol-
gel method commonly appliedfor preparing sol-gel derived inorganic glasses 
and Class I organic-inorganic hybrid materials since more than three decades 
ago. The Class I hybrid materials, which are derived from tetraethoxysilane 
(TEOS) or tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), have been successfully employed for 
various applications ranging from bulk glasses to optical fibers, thin film 
coatings, ultra-pure powders and multifunctional materials [15-17].However, it 
seems that those Class I hybrid materials are not feasible to be applied for 
building complicated structures, particularly micro/nano-structures.  
In Class II hybrid polymers, the organic network can be formed by 
photopolymerization of the polymerizable organic groups, offering the 
possibility of fabrication methods by photolithography, laser direct writing or 
other novel fabrication techniques [13,14]. Fabrication of micro and nano-
structured optical/photonic components using these hybrid polymers have been 
demonstrated by using those techniques [13,14,18,19]. This paper presents the 
precursor gel preparation of this class of hybrid polymer from methacrylate-
ester modified siloxane by sol-gel technique and its application for constructing 
diffractive optic based components, such as Distributed Feedback (DFB) 
grating for photopumped lasers and grating based Surface Plasmon Resonance 
(SPR) coupler. In this work, laser interference technique using high power 
pulsed UV laser was applied for fabricating those gratings, which is distinctly 
different from the fabrication methods in previous reports mentioned above 
 Applications of Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Polymers 209 
 
[18,19]. 
2 Methodology 
Precursor gels of hybrid polymers were synthesized from 3-
(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TMSPMA)by sol-gel route. Monomer 
solution was prepared by dissolving TMSPMA monomer in a mixture solution 
of water and ethanol. For use in the fabrication of DFB grating for 
photopumped lasing purpose, this monomer solution was added with organic 
laser dye, either Rhodamine 6G (R6G) or4-dicyanmethylene-2-methyl-6-(p-
dimethyl-aminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM).However, this monomer solution 
wasused without addition of any organic laser dye for use in the fabrication of 
SPR grating coupler. Those monomer solutions were then processed by sol-gel 
method as described elsewhere with some modification in its processing 
conditions, until gel formed as its final product [20].Thin films of polymer 
precursor gel were prepared by spin casting technique after addition of a small 
amount of photoinitiator (Irgacure 819) into the precursor gel solution. Those 
gel films were subjected to UV photocuring using a Hg lamp or a 
semiconductor laser (405 nm). Basic molecular structure characterization was 
carried out by means of FTIR spectroscopy, whereas basic optical 
characterizations were carried out by UV-Vis spectroscopy and thin film 
reflectometry. 
Fabrication ofDFB grating structure with laser interference technique was 
performed by using Lloyd mirror configuration, as illustrated schematically in 
Figure1, and the frequency-tripled (THG) output of Nd-YAG laser(355 nm) as 
the coherent light source. The interfering light beams at the precursor gel film 
will be absorbed by photoinitiator resulting in photopolymerization rate that 
varies spatially following the formed interference pattern. Those laser 
interfering beams both in scribe interference pattern and cure the precursor gel. 
Therefore, the wavelength of this laser beam can be also referred as curing 
wavelength, namely ?curing = 355 nm. The laser power was about 200 mW with 
beam diameter of about 1.2 cm, which is equivalent to laser fluence of about 18 
mJ/cm
2
. The pulse duration was about 10 ns and the number of pulses was 
about 2-5times. The grating surface structure was investigated by Atomic Force 
Microscopy (AFM). The grating periodicities were determined from those AFM 
images.  
In order to investigate the possibility and characteristics of photopumped lasing 
in those fabricated DFB gratings, the grating was placed in a photopumped laser 
configuration optically pumped by a strip-line shaped laser beam from the 
frequency doubled Nd-YAG laser (?pump = 532 nm).In order to investigate the 
fabricated grating as a SPR grating coupler, the grating was previously covered 
210 Rahmat Hidayat, et al. 
by very thin Ag layer of about 50 nm thickness. This coupler element was then 
placed and evaluated in a SPR spectroscopy system as described in literatures 
[21,22].

3 Results and Discussion 
3.1 Molecular Characterizations of Products 
The whole reaction of sol-gel process involves the hydrolysis of silicon 
alkoxides and then followed by a cascade of condensation and poly-
condensation reactions, resulting in the formation of inorganic Si-O-Si network, 
as indicated in the Scheme 1 [11,14].The photopolymerization reaction occurs 
through radical polymerization mechanism which involves radical initiation and 
chain elongations resulting in the formation of cross-linked methacrylate 
network, as indicated in Scheme 2 [14]. After photopolymerization, according 
to Scheme 2, there will be a change in molecular structure due to the conversion 
of carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) into carbon-carbon single bond(C-C) in 
methacrylic group.

Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of hybrid polymer precursor gel measured 
before and after photopolymerization. In comparison between the FTIR 
spectrum of TMSPMA monomer and the precursor gel (before 
photopolymerization), infrared absorption bands at ? = ?800 cm-1 and 1100 cm-1 
were significantly suppressed [23].Those absorption bands are related to the 
suppression of symmetric and asymmetric stretching of Si-O bonds, 
respectively. The suppression of those bands thus indicates the formation of 
inorganic network. As evident in Figure2, after photopolymerization, the 
absorption band at 1635 cm
-1
 decreases indicating the reduction of C=C 
vibration due to the conversion as mentioned above. A broad absorption band in 
the region of 3500 cm
-1
 is assigned to O-H vibration, which may be due to the 
presence of the remaining water, ethanol and unreacted O-H group inside the 
precursor gel. Water and ethanol are expected to evaporate or disappear from 
the film during post-baking process after photopolymerization step, but the 
unreacted hydroxyl (O-H) groups may be still remain present in the film. This 
O-H vibration band therefore becomes smaller but still remains in the FTIR 
spectrum taken after photopolymerization in methacrylic group.

Using that formula, the grating periodicities were estimated to be about 1022, 
454, 420, 391, and 366 nm for incident angles of 10Åã, 23Åã, 25Åã, 27Åã, and 29Åã, 
respectively. Figure 3(a) and 3(b) shows the AFM images of a grating structure 
prepared at the incident angle of interference laser of 10Åã. This grating has 
periodicity of about 1000 nm, which is close to the estimated value above. 
As depicted from the AFM images, sinusoidal corrugation structure was formed 
with the grating depth of about 20-45 nm. The formation mechanism of this 
corrugated grating structure is still not well understood at this stage, however 
we suppose the formation may occur through some possible mechanisms as 
followings. The first possibility may be related with polymerization induced 
volume shrinkage. At the bright region, high laser intensity produces high 
degree of photopolymerization which causes volume shrinkage as the precursor 
gel changing into solid. On the other hand, at the dark region, 
photopolymerization occurs with relatively low reaction rate so that there is no 
significant volume shrinkage. As the bright region suffers more volume 
shrinkage, the bright region would create valley while the dark region will 
create bump. However, there is also other possible formation mechanism that 
includes monomer diffusion during the polymerization. As the monomer 
concentration quickly vanishes at the bright region due to high polymerization 
rate, this condition leads to the diffusion of monomer from dark region to bright 
region. The monomers are then attracted and accumulated at the bright region. 
This mechanism, which is called as photo-induced swelling, results in bump 
formation at the bright region but valley formation at the dark region [18,19]. 
It should be also noted that, however, in this work the grating structure was 
formed by using pulse laser energy of about 20 mJ/pulse, which is equivalent to 
light power of about 2 MW/cm
2
 per pulse. This fabrication condition is 
significantly different from that found in the fabrication method used in the 
previous reports [18,19].A light beam with such optical power may theoretically 
generate optical radiation force in the order of 10
-3
 N/cm
2  
[24,25]. Regarding to 
this fact, though it is still speculative at the moment, one may also suggest the 
mechanism formation due to radiation pressure effect. When the interfering 
laser beams with high laser impinge on the surface of the precursor gel film, the 
light momentum will be transferred to the precursor molecules. If the precursor 
 Applications of Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Polymers 213 
 
(a) (b) 
gels is considered to be composed of nano-sizeparticulates, [14] this momentum 
transfer may lead to the displacement of those precursor gel particulates in the 
same direction with the laser beam propagation direction. However, in the same 
time, the laser beam also induces cross linking photopolymerization and prevent 
the precursor to move back. This process creates bump at the dark region and 
valley at the bright region, producing a corrugation structure mimicking the 
intensity profile of interfering laser beams. Such process will not happen in SU-
8 resin because the radiation force is not sufficiently enough to displace these 
resin molecules which have much larger molecular weight. Further specific 
experimental works, however, are required to verify which one of those possible 
mechanisms explained above actually responsible for the grating formation here 
is.

3.3 Application as Distributed Feedback Grating and Photo-
pumped Lasing 
Fabricated DBF grating evaluated in a photopumped laser configuration, which 
is optically pumped by the frequency doubled Nd-YAG pulse laser. Figure 4(a) 
shows the emission spectra measured from hybrid polymer DFB grating 
containing R6G organic laser dye. At low laser pumping energy, only 
fluorescence spectrum was observed from the sample. A thigh laser pumping 
energy, the emission spectral shape then changes indicated by much narrower 
spectral width with FWHM less than 2 nm, which is in the limit range of the 
spectrophotometer resolution (~1nm). Figure 4(b) shows that the emission 
spectral width and peak intensity start to change abruptly at the pumping laser 
intensity of about 0.1 mJ/pulse, which is the threshold pumping energy. This 
clearly indicates the generation of lasing actions in this fabricated DFB grating 
structure. The relationship between lasing wavelength, Bragg wavelength and 
grating periodicity is given by

where m is the Bragg reflection order, and neff is the effective refractive index. 
As evident in Figure 4(a), lasing was observed at about 580 nm from a grating 
prepared at incident angle of 27?. The observed lasing wavelength is in 
agreement with the estimated lasing wavelength calculated using Eq.(2), for m= 
2, as indicated in Table 1. This fact also indicates that the lasing occurs at the 
second order (m= 2) of Bragg reflection wavelength. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It should be noted that the lasing performance, indicated by lasing wavelength 
and threshold energy, is critically dependent on the geometrical structure of the 
grating, such as the grating periodicity and corrugation depth. As the grating 
formation may involve volume shrinkage or photo-induced swelling 
mechanism, the deviation in geometrical structure may occur at each time of 
fabrication leading to unpredictable degree of deviation in its performance. It is 
therefore necessary to study further in separate work how to improve the 
precursor gel and the fabrication technique in order to minimize geometrical 
structure deviation.

3.4 Application as Coupling Elements for Surface Plasmon 
Resonance Generation 
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a collective oscillation of electrons at the 
flat metal surface (at the metal/dielectric interface), which is in resonant 
condition with the incoming electromagnetic or light wave. The condition for 
resonance is given by [13,14]:

 (3) 
where Ksp is the propagation constant of the SPR wave, while É√1 and É√2 are the 
permittivity of metal and dielectric, respectively. In this case, surface wave can 
be generated by using a prism coupler, which is constructed of a flat metal 
coated on a prism. In the present work, we fabricated SPR grating couplers that 
are constructed from a hybrid polymer grating covered by a very thin metal 
layer (approx. 50 nm) on its top surface. Such SPR grating coupler has 
attractive much attention for various bio-chemical molecular sensing 
applications [26-28]. The resonance condition for grating coupled SPR 
configuration is:

?
? ?
?
 (4) 
where Ki is the propagation constant of the incoming light along the grating 
surface, ? is the grating periodicity and m is an integer (= Å}1, Å}2, Åc ) that 
denotes the diffraction order [26]. 
216 Rahmat Hidayat, et al. 
The fabricated grating, from precursor gel without addition of any laser dye 
substance, was covered by thin film silver layer with about only 50 nm in 
thickness. The grating periodicity is about 670 nm. Figure 5(a) shows the SPR 
spectrum measured for water as the dielectric layer, which is in direct contact 
with the silver layer. The spectrum shows two dips, which is typical SPR 
spectrum obtained by using grating coupled SPR configuration. This is 
distinctly different from SPR spectrum measured from SPR system with prism 
coupled configuration, which normally exhibits only one spectrum dip. In the 
case of grating coupler SPR element, the Plasmon wave suffers Bragg reflection 
leading to the formation of standing wave. Such condition creates a forbidden 
gap and splits the dispersion curve at the cross-section, as commonly observed 
in photonic crystal theory [29].The SPR spectrum now therefore exhibits two 
SPR dips. The spectral shape of the dip is much narrower and deeper in 
comparison to that of measured by using just flat metal as in prism-coupled SPR 
system. Figure 5(b) the shifting of SPR dip from 691 nm to 695 nm and 702 nm 
with increasing glucose concentration in water from 0 g/dL to 10 g/dl and 20 
g/dL, respectively. This concentration change is corresponding to the change of 
solution refractive index from 1.30 to 1.32 and 1.34, respectively. This result 
demonstrates that the fabricated grating performs well as a SPR grating coupler, 
which can be applied in the refractive index measurement applications.

4 Conclusion 
Precursor gels of hybrid polymers containing polymerizable methacrylate group 
have been prepared via sol-gel route. Grating structure has been successfully 
fabricated on the surface of this hybrid polymer film by laser interference 
technique utilizing high power UV pulse laser. The resulted gratings have 
sinusoidal corrugated structure with periodicity in the range 400-1000 nm, 
which can be selected by adjusting the incident angle. The mechanism 
formation still cannot clearly verified at this stage, but it may involve an 
interesting mechanism by considering the time duration required for the grating 
formation. The applications of those fabricated grating structures for generation 
of photopumped lasing and SPR wave have been also successfully 
demonstrated. The present experimental results thus also demonstrate the 
feasibility of this hybrid polymer as a building material for nanostructured 
optical/photonic components.
