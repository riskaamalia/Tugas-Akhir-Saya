Abstract. An experimental study of 23 low-, medium- and high-strength 
concrete columns is presented in this paper. Square-confined concrete columns 
without longitudinal reinforcement were designed, and tested under concentric 
axial compression. The columns were made of concrete with a compressive 
strength ranging between 30 MPa and 70 MPa. The test parameters in the study 
are concrete compressive strengths and confining steel properties, i.e. spacing, 
volumetric ratios and configurations. The effects of these parameters on the 
strength and ductility of square-confined concrete were evaluated. Of the 
specimens tested in this study, the columns made with higher-strength concrete 
produced less strength enhancement and ductility than those with lower-strength 
concrete. The steel configurations were found to have an important role in 
governing the strength and ductility of the confined high-strength concrete. 
Moreover, several models of strength enhancement for confined concrete 
available in the literature turned out to be quite accurate in predicting the 
experimental results. 
Keywords: confinement; ductility; high-strength concrete; strength. 
1 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
High-strength concrete (HSC) is gaining popularity in the last decade. This 
material has been used in many types of constructions, such as high-rise 
buildings, bridges, marine structures, offshore platforms etc. One of the 
advantageous characteristics of high-strength concrete is the high strength-to-
weight ratio. This enables the use of reinforced concrete columns with smaller 
cross-sectional dimensions for high-rise buildings. 
The development of concrete technology and practice has led to a changing 
perception of the definition of high-strength concrete [1-3]. CEB-FIP [4] and 
 Confined Low, Medium and High-Strength Concrete 253 
 
Nishiyama [5] define HSC as a concrete having a minimum 28-day compressive 
strength of 60 MPa. In North America, HSC is usually considered to be a 
concrete with a 28-day compressive strength of at least 41 MPa. In this paper, 
concrete with a strength up to 41 MPa is defined as low-strength concrete, 
concrete with a strength from 41 to 55 MPa as medium-strength concrete, and 
concrete with a strength above 55 MPa as high-strength concrete. 
Although high-strength concrete offers many advantages in terms of 
performance, and also costs, its brittle behavior remains a major drawback in 
the case of seismic applications. Because of their brittleness, high-strength 
concrete columns commonly exhibit premature cover spalling under high 
compression [6]. 
Many researchers have reported the lack of ductility and deformation capacity 
of HSC columns [7-10]. The ductility of reinforced concrete columns depends 
on the confinement provided by confining steel. Therefore, concrete 
confinement is a critical issue for HSC columns in seismic regions [5,10]. 
Current design provisions in the Indonesian National Standard for reinforced-
concrete design of buildings (SNI-03-2847-2002) [11], which is similar to ACI 
318 [12], are not applicable to the design of HSC columns. Strength and 
ductility aspects of HSC columns are one area where design provisions are still 
limited.  
Early research on confined concrete, leading to the formulation of empirical 
stress-strain relationships, was generally carried out on small- and large-scale, 
concentrically loaded specimens. Many research reports on confined concrete 
(fÅfc?38 MPa) are available in the literature [13-15]. The same can be said about 
confined high-strength concrete [7,9,10,16-19]. However, very limited test data 
are available from experimental investigations covering low-, medium- and 
high-strength concrete column specimens. The common approach in the 
literature is to study cases with different concrete strength classifications 
separately. Many design variables have been considered in each of these 
researches. The amount of confining steel receives the most attention in many 
researches. Other test parameters considered include the compressive strength 
of concrete, the yield strength of rebar, the distribution of longitudinal steel, tie 
spacing, and cross-section dimensions. It is the purpose of the research 
presented in this paper to complement the available confined concrete database 
with the compressive strength of confined concrete ranging from low to high. 
The results of this study will provide much needed general design information 
for normal- and high-strength concrete columns.

1.2 Research Significance 
Research on confined concrete, especially with a wide range of compressive 
strengths (i.e. covering normal- and high-strength concrete), still needs to be 
conducted. The design equations in the present concrete code are only 
applicable for normal-strength concrete columns (fÅfc?55 MPa) [11,12]. 
Research focusing on confined concrete columns with a compressive strength 
ranging from normal to high will provide a significant contribution to the 
understanding of the general behavior of confined concrete. 
2 Experimental Programs 
2.1 Materials and Ranges of Concrete Strengths 
Three different mixes were used to attain the cylindrical strength targets of low-
, medium- and high-strength concrete, denoted as L, M and H (see Table 2). For 
this research, the sand and coarse aggregate used were taken from a local 
quarry. The size of the coarse aggregate was in the range between 8 and 14 mm. 
A superplasticizer (SP) from the brand named Sikament NN was used to 
improve the workability of the high-strength concrete mixes. In addition, for the 
high-strength mixes fifteen percent by weight of the Portland cement was 
replaced with Fly Ash. 
The confining steel used was plain rebar with a diameter of 5.5 mm and a yield 
strength of 398 MPa. The yield strength was determined by tension tests of 
three sample bars (Figure 1). 
Table 1 summarizes the dimensions, number of test specimens, concrete 
strengths and volumetric ratios of confining steel used in several experimental 
studies conducted on square-confined concrete columns under concentric 
loadings, from 1990 to 2007. Most of the studies shown in Table 1 were 
conducted either with low-, medium- or high-strength concrete columns. Only 
one study was conducted with a wider range of concrete strengths, i.e. from 
low- to high-strength concrete [16].

from 30 to 70 MPa. This range was selected to complement the database of 
columns tested under concentric loading as shown in Table 1.

2.2 Specimen Details and Instrumentation 
For this research, 23 confined and unconfined concrete columns (dimensions 
100 x 100 x 500 mm) were designed. Figure 2 shows the columnsÅf cross-
sections and instrumentation. The specimens were designed without 
longitudinal reinforcement or concrete cover in order to study purely the 
behavior of the confining steel. For the purpose of the test, the total height of 
each column was divided into 3 regions, comprising of two 150 mm regions at 
each end of the column, and a 200 mm region in the middle. The specimens 
were categorized into four configurations as shown in Table 2 (i.e. 
configurations A, B, C and D), representing different arrangements of confining 
 
256 Antonius & Iswandi Imran 
steel. FLA-5 type strain gauges were used to monitor the strains in the confining 
steel, and displacement transducers (LVDT) were used to measure axial 
deformations in the tested columns.

Axial deformations were measured within each of the 3 regions along the 
column height. The overall head movement of the test machine was also 
measured. All instrumentations were connected to a computer-based data 
acquisition system. Figure 3 shows the reinforcement cages. 
2.3 Test Procedure   
All columns were tested under concentric compression produced by a Dartec 
Universal Testing Machine (UTM) with a capacity of 1200 kN. The tests were 
done under displacement control. The test setup is shown in Figure 4. The load 
was given in regular increments, and sets of deformation readings were taken at 
every load stage.

2.4 Strength and Ductility Computation 
Strength enhancement due to confinement is expressed as the ratio of confined 
to unconfined concrete strength in the member (i.e. K=fÅfcc/fÅfco). The confined 
concrete area was measured from center to center of the steel perimeter. The 
history of experimentally measured axial strain of confined concrete can be 
 
 
258 Antonius & Iswandi Imran 
obtained from the average axial shortening readings from LVDT divided by the 
vertical length of the test region. 
For this research, the energy method was used to measure ductility. With this 
method the ductility is calculated based on the area under concrete stress (fcc) 
versus the axial strain (É√) curve (see Figure 5). The ductility indices are denoted 
as É E, that is the area OACDE divided by the area OAB, where B corresponds 
to the yield strain É√y, and E corresponds to the point of first fracture of the 
confining steel. The 0.85fÅfcc rule is used to define the yield strain. 
 
Figure 5 Ductility measurement. 
3 Experimental Results and Discussion 
The results of the experimental work on the test specimens are provided in 
Table 2 and Figure 6 shows examples of failure in the test specimens.  
Figure 7 shows the measured stress-strain results of the tested columns. The 
ascending branches of measured stress-strain relationships in all test columns 
are almost linear. In addition, the descending branches of the columns with a 
higher-strength concrete are steeper than those with a lower-strength concrete. 
The unconfined concrete columns, i.e. SCL, SCM and SCH, failed in a sudden 
and explosive manner at peak load. The measured compressive strength of 
unconfined concrete for low-, medium- and high-strength concrete were 
respectively 0.86, 0.85 and 0.82 of the compressive strength of the concrete 
cylinder.

Experimental studies of high-strength concrete columns conducted by many 
researchers indicate that confining steel does not yield at peak response 
[1,10,21]. Similar behavior can also be seen in the specimens made of medium- 
and high-strength concrete tested in this study, especially those with a high 
volumetric ratio of confining steel (i.e. specimens BH5, DM5 and DH5).  
3.1 Effect of Compressive Strength 
Concrete strength is one of the primary variables investigated extensively in this 
test. Columns with the same amount and arrangement of reinforcement but with 
distinctly different concrete strengths were tested to study the effects of this 
parameter. 
Figure 7 shows the comparison of four columns with different concrete 
strengths. The results indicate a consistent decrease in strength enhancement 
and ductility as the concrete strength increases. However, when the volumetric 
ratio of confining steel is moderate, as in the case of column CH5, the column 
shows ductile behavior and the effect of the concrete strength becomes 
insignificant. 
The relationship between the concrete strength and the strength enhancement of 
confined concrete (K) with different configuration variables can be seen in 
Figure 8. All of the specimens show a decrease of strength enhancement as the 
concrete strength increases. It can also be seen that the specimen with 
configuration D has the highest K value for low-strength concrete (fÅfc=34 MPa). 
The specimen with configuration B has the highest K value for medium- and 
high-strength concrete.

 Confined Low, Medium and High-Strength Concrete 261 
 
Figure 8 also shows that when the volumetric ratio of confining steel is very 
high, as in the case of specimens with configuration D, the K value decreases 
quickly when used with medium- and high-strength concrete.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8 Influence of strength enhancement of confined concrete on concrete 
strength. 
3.2 Effect of Tie Spacing  
Experimental and theoretical evidence has shown that tie spacing plays a 
significant role in the mechanism of confined concrete [1,10,15]. The behavior 
of confined concrete with different tie spacings is shown in Figure 9. The 
columns have a different volumetric ratio of confining steel. The effectiveness 
of the confining steel diminishes quickly when the tie spacing increases. 
Specimens with a wide tie spacing may not develop any confinement. The 
medium- and high-strength concrete specimens tested in this study did not 
develop any confinement when the tie spacing was equal to the cross-section 
(see Figure 9 for specimens AM10, AH10, BM10, BH10, CM10, CH10, DM10 
and DH10). 
3.3 Effect of Volumetric Ratio and Steel Configuration 
In general, both the strength and ductility of confined concrete increase as the 
volumetric ratio increases. An increase in the volumetric ratio of confining steel 
can also be expressed in terms of the confining configuration. This parameter 
affects the distribution of the confinement pressure and hence of its efficiency.

Figure 9 Curves of confined concrete with different tie spacings: (a) steel 
configurations A and B; (b) steel configurations C and D. 
The significance of the volumetric ratio of confining steel is illustrated in Figure 
10. The test data indicate that both the strength and the ductility of medium- and 
high-strength concrete increase as the volumetric ratio increases. Specimens 
with a low volumetric ratio (specimens with configuration A) exhibit brittle 
behavior, showing a high rate of strength decay immediately after peak 
response.

configurations 
 
It is clear from Table 2 and Figure 10 that steel configuration B for confined 
low- and medium-strength concrete shows better ductility compared to the other 
configurations. Note that the specimens with configuration B have the highest 
volumetric ratio. Similar behavior was observed in confined high-strength 
concrete. The lateral pressure of the confining steel in specimen CH5 
(Éœs=3.02%) is more effective for improving the ductility of the confined 
concrete than in the specimens with a higher volumetric ratio (BH5, Éœs=3.43% 
and DH5, Éœs=3.63%). The confining steel of specimen CH5 yields at peak 
response, so that the maximum lateral pressure can be mobilized. However, in 
specimens BH5 and DH5 the confining steel does not yield at peak response. 
These results confirm that the configuration of confining steel has significant 
effects on the ductility of confined high-strength concrete. 
3.4 Efficiency of Confinement 
The confining-steel requirements in SNI-03-2847-2002 [11] and ACI 318 [12] 
are based on an arbitrary performance criterion that requires columns to 
maintain their concentric capacities beyond the spalling of the concrete cover. 
Therefore, the requirements for rectilinear reinforcement are obtained through 
an arbitrary extension of the requirements for circular spirals [5]. Hence, the 
configuration and the resulting efficiency of the confining steel are not 
recognized as design parameters.   
The experimental results discussed above indicate that the test variables have a 
significant influence on confinement efficiency. Saatcioglu & Razvi [14] 
introduced the efficiency of confining steel through coefficient k2:

similar phenomenon is occured in the investigation carried out by Saatcioglu 
and Razvi [10].

3.5 Comparison of Strength Enhancement of the Confined 
Concrete Equations 
The strength enhancement of confined concrete (K) as discussed above plays an 
important role in governing the minimum requirements for confining steel in 
reinforced concrete columns. Figure 12 shows a comparison between the 
strength enhancement values of confined concrete (K) from this study and from 
equations proposed by Ansari & Li [22], CEB-FIP [23], Imran & 
Pantazopoulou [24], Muguruma, et al. [9] and Legeron & Paultre [3]. Strength 
enhancement equations for confined concrete are shown in Table 3, including a 
comparison of results between equations and experimental results, denoted by 
the Coefficient of Variation (COV) value.  
The comparison shows that the COV value for the Ansari & Li equation is 
23.3% and for the CEB-FIP equation is greater than 10%. Other equations 
 
 Confined Low, Medium and High-Strength Concrete 265 
 
provide a good prediction of the K value with a COV of less than 10% (see 
Table 3).

4 Conclusion 
The behavior of confining steel at peak response of confined high-strength 
concrete indicates that yield is not always reached, although the yield strength 
of the confining steel used, i.e. 398 MPa, is still within the value recommended 
by the concrete code (i.e. <400 MPa). This fact is critical for the confinement 
modeling, especially to predict the amount of lateral stress developed in the 
confining steel. It is clear from the experimental results that the descending 
branch of confined low-, medium- and high-strength concrete varied 
significantly, depending on the design parameters (concrete strength, volumetric 
ratio and tie spacing of confining steel). The configuration of confining steel 
also has a significant influence on the ductility behavior of low- to high-strength 
confined concrete. This behavior has not been considered in the code 
philosophy of maintaining axial load capacity of a section after cover spalling. 
Strength enhancement and ductility of confined concrete tend to decrease as the 
concrete strength increases which means that strength and ductility diminish in 
confined high-strength concrete. The effectiveness of the confining steel 
diminishes quickly as the tie spacing increases. Specimens with a tie spacing 
similar to the core dimension cannot develop confinement, so that the behavior 
produced is similar to that of unconfined concrete.

 Confined Low, Medium and High-Strength Concrete 267 
 
The tensile force developed in confining steel for high-strength concrete is 
indirectly proportional to the amount of confining reinforcement, such as the 
volumetric ratio. The volume expansion of high-strength concrete is smaller 
than that of low-strength concrete. This phenomenon delays the yielding of the 
confining steel to the post-peak response of the confined column. This 
influences the effectiveness of reinforcement in confining the concrete core. 
Several equations proposed for estimating the strength enhancement of confined 
concrete (K) exhibit good agreement with the experimental results, namely the 
Muguruma et al. model, the Imran & Pantazoupoulou model and the Legeron & 
Paultre model. This indicates that the models can be utilized to predict the K 
value of confined low-, medium- and high-strength concrete columns with 
square sections, as long as the effectively confined concrete core area is 
considered properly.
