Abstract. One of the important requirements for earthquake resistant building 
related to confinement is the use of seismic hooks in the hoop or confining 
reinforcement of reinforced-concrete column elements. However, installation of 
a confining reinforcement with a 135-degree hook is not easy. Therefore, in 
practice, many construction workers apply a confining reinforcement with a 90-
degreehook (non-code compliant). Based on research and records of recent 
earthquakes in Indonesia, the use of a non-code compliant confining 
reinforcement for concrete columns produces structures with poor seismic 
performance. This paper presents a study that introduces an additional element 
that is expected to improve the effectiveness of concrete columns confined with 
a non-code compliant confining reinforcement. The additional element, named a 
pen-binder, is used to keep the non-code compliant confining reinforcement in 
place. The effectiveness of this element under pure axial concentric loading was 
investigatedcomprehensively.The specimens tested in this study were 18 
concrete columns,with a cross-section of 170 mm x 170 mm and a height of 480 
mm. The main test variables were the material type of the pen-binder, the angle 
of the hook, and the confining reinforcement configuration.The test results 
indicate that adding pen-binders can effectively improve the strength and 
ductility of the column specimens confined with a non-code compliant confining 
reinforcement.  
Keywords: column; confinement; hook; non-compliance; pen-binder. 
1 Introduction 
Some parts of Indonesia are located in regions with high seismic risk. In such 
regions it is compulsory to build structures that consistently meet the stringent 
requirements of earthquake resistant building construction. Consistent 
implementation of earthquake resistant design results in a structure that can 
survive a strong earthquake.   
 Confinement of Reinforced Concrete Column 221 
 
One of the seismic provisions of the SNI 03-2847-02 code [1] requires that the 
reinforced-concrete columns of a structure are confined using a hoop 
reinforcement with a seismic hook (135Åã). Installation of this kind of confining 
reinforcement is very tedious, especially in the case of large-dimension columns 
commonly used for high-rise buildings, flyovers and bridges. Therefore, at 
construction sites the installation of this kind of confining reinforcement is 
sometimes simplified by using a confining reinforcement with a 90-degreehook 
or with a double C configuration. Some reports about earthquake induced 
structural damage in Indonesia show examples of building collapse caused by 
inappropriate installation of confining reinforcements in reinforced-concrete 
columns [2-4]. Furthermore, many research studies on reinforced-concrete 
columns using confining reinforcements with a 90-degreehook show that the 
opening of the hook initiates failure, leading to buckling of the outer 
longitudinal reinforcing bars, and results in poor seismic performance of the 
structure (Sheikh [5], Saatcioglu [6], Wehbe [7]).  
For this reason, the use of confining reinforcements with a 90-degreehook or 
with a double C configuration is basically not recommended for reinforced-
concrete columns. Nevertheless, this non-code compliant confining reinforce-
ment is widely applied in the field because of the ease of its placement. The 
research reported in this paper introduces a simple device called a Ågpen-binderÅh 
that can be attached to non-code compliant confining reinforcements at 
construction sites. This Ågpen-binderÅh is expected to improve the structural 
performance of non-code compliant confining reinforcements to be at least 
equal to that of compliant confining reinforcements. 
2 Confinement Reinforcement 
Transverse reinforcement specified in design codes for reinforced concrete 
beams and columns has three main functions. These are: (1) to prevent buckling 
of longitudinal reinforcing bars; (2) to provide shear resistance; (3) to confine 
the concrete core. 
Confinement of reinforced concrete columns is intended to prevent the spall 
cover of a tied column from failing immediately because the strength of the core 
is enhanced by triaxial stresses resulting from the confining effect of the 
transverse or hoop reinforcement. As a result, the column can undergo large 
deformations, eventually reaching a second maximum load when the 
reinforcement yields. The provision of transverse or confining reinforcement in 
the current SNI/ACI code is based on the work of Richart [8], and is developed 
so that the compressive strength of the confined core of a column after cover 
spalling is equal to the compressive strength of the gross section of the column 
before cover spalling.

Based on this concept, the total cross-sectional area of a rectangular confining 
reinforcement, Ash, should not be less than that required by Eq. (1):

where s is center-to-center spacing, hc the cross-sectional dimension of the 
column core measured center to center from the outer legs of the confining 
reinforcement, fyh the specified yield strength of the confining reinforcement, Ag 
the gross area of the concrete section, and Ach the cross-sectional area of the 
concrete core measured out to out of the confining reinforcement.  
The effectiveness of the confining reinforcement primarily depends on the 
volume of the concrete that is confined and the resulting distribution of the 
confining pressure [9]. In a column element, the ductility of the column cross-
section under flexure is strongly influenced by the level of axial load. The 
higher the axial load the greater the reduction in the level of ductility produced 
(Sheikh and Yeh [5], Paultre and Legeron [10]). 
In order to function properly, the confining reinforcement should be tied with 
hooks that provide lateral support to the longitudinal reinforcement. The hooks 
should be anchored into the concrete core in order to satisfy the seismic hoop 
requirements. The Indonesian concrete code defines the seismic hook as a hook 
on a hoop (Detail A), crosstie (Detail B) or stirrup (Detail C), having a bend of 
no less than 135degrees at its ends (see Figure 1).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 Seimic hook detailing. 
The use of a confining reinforcement with a 90-degreehook is not recommended 
in the Indonesian concrete code, because this kind of confining reinforcement 
may result in poor seismic performance of the reinforced concrete columns. 
Previous researchers have shown that the failure of rectangular columns 
 Confinement of Reinforced Concrete Column 223 
 
confined with a 90-degree hook reinforcement under cyclic load was initiated 
by the opening of the hook in the plastic hinge region. This was followed by 
buckling of the outer longitudinal rebar [7]. Lukkunaprasit and Sittipunt [11] 
have introduced a supplementary tie or hook-clips to prevent premature opening 
of a confining reinforcement with 90-degree hooks. They found that the clips 
can effectively hold the 90-degree hook ties after the loss of the concrete cover. 
However, according to Lukkunaprasit and Sittipunt, the use of these hook-clips 
can only be recommended for reinforced-concretecolumns in intermediate 
moment resisting frames. 
3 Confinement Model 
The influence of the tie arrangement on square columns was modeled for the 
first time by Sheikh and Uzumeri [12] using the Ågeffectively confined core areaÅh 
concept. Subsequently, this model was modified by Sheikh and Yeh [5] in order 
to incorporate the effects of eccentric loading. Later, a theoretical model was 
proposed by Mander [13], with a wider scope than the previously proposed 
models. His model also utilized the effectively confined core area concept. The 
maximum transverse pressure from the confining reinforcement can only be 
exerted effectively on that part of the concrete core where the confining stress 
has fully developed due to the arching action. The arching action is assumed to 
follow second-degree parabolas with an initial tangent slope of 45 degrees. 
Arching occurs vertically between layers of transverse reinforcement, and 
horizontally between tied longitudinal bars (Figure 2).

Midway between the levels of the confining reinforcement, the area of

The effectively confined concrete core area at hoop level is found by subtracting 
the area of the parabolas containing the ineffectively confined concrete. 
Incorporating the influence of the ineffective area in the elevation, the 
effectively confined concrete core area midway between the confining 
reinforcement levels [13] is

In order to allow for the fact that the effective confined core area is basically 
smaller than the core area, the effective lateral confining pressure acting 
uniformly at the core area can be considered as

where As is the total area of confining reinforcement, and fyh the yield strength of 
the confining reinforcement. For sections with equal confining pressure in two

where  fÅfcc and f

co are the confined and unconfined strength of the concrete. 
Subsequently, another model was proposed by Saatcioglu and Razvi [6], 
relating strength and deformability to lateral confining pressure. Their model is 
based on the computation of equivalent uniform confining pressure resulting 
from different confining reinforcement configurations. Passive confining 
pressure exerted by a square hoop depends on the restraining force developed in 
 Confinement of Reinforced Concrete Column 225 
 
the confining reinforcement. The confining reinforcement can develop high 
restraining forces at the corners or hook ends, and a low restraining action in 
other locations. Figure 3 illustrates the build-up of passive confinement pressure 
in a square column. If crossties or internal confining reinforcements are used to 
support the intermediate longitudinal bars, additional points of high lateral 
restraint are generated.

The equivalent uniform pressure fle is derived from the average pressure fl. The 
average pressure is the summation of transverse forces Asfyh (area and yield 
strength of transverse reinforcement) divided by the area bound by the core 
dimensions, measured center to center of the perimeter hoop (bc) and center to 
center of the tie spacing (s). Coefficient k1 is obtained from a regression analysis 
of test data. Richart, et al. [8] reported that Eq. (7) with a constant value of 4.1 
for k1 produces a good correlation with spirally reinforced test cylinders. Their 
recommendations formed the basis for the confining reinforcement 
requirements of the ACI building code. For rectangular confining

reinforcements the average pressure cannot reflect the true effect of the actual 
confinement pressure. In this case an equivalent uniform pressure is needed if 
Eq. (7) is to be used. The equivalent uniform pressure fle used in Eq. (7) is often 
smaller than the average uniform pressure fl, because of the non-uniformity of 
the lateral pressure. The reduction in pressure is reflected through coefficient k2, 
which is a function of the tie spacing and the spacing of the laterally supported 
longitudinal reinforcement sl. 
4 Experimental Program 
4.1 Test Specimens 
In this study 18 column specimens were tested, 170 mm x 170 mm in cross-
section and 480 mm in height. Figure 4a illustrates the test specimens and the 
pen-binder geometry. The test series reported here was designed to investigate 
three parameters influencing the behavior of the columns: the type of pen-
binder material used, the angle of the applied hook, and the confining 
reinforcement configuration. Two types of materials were used in this case, i.e.: 
steel and ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) plastic. The use of a plastic 
material for the pen-binder is to avoid corrosion of the material due to the 
inadequacy of the concrete to cover the pen-binder. The different confining 
reinforcement configurations used for the test are illustrated in Figure 5.

4.2 Test Setup 
The column specimens were tested using a Dartec compression testing machine 
with a 1500 kN load capacity (Figure 7).  
The specimens were externally confined in the top and bottom regions by steel 
brackets. Linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs) were placed on each 
column face to measure the axial deformations of the specimens. Strain in the 
confining reinforcement was measured using electric resistance strain gauges 
(Figure 4b). The specimens were loaded slowly. LVDTs were monitored 
throughout loading to insure concentric loading and the resulting data were 
recorded with a data logger. The loading was continued until a significant drop 
in load capacity was observed.

5 Test Results and Observed Behavior 
5.1 Test Results 
All column specimens showed a similar response up to their peak loads. The 
first crack appeared on the column faces at a concrete strain of approximately 
0.2 percent. The measured peak load and the corresponding axial strain varied 
depending on the confining reinforcement configuration and the type of pen-
binder material used (Figure 8). It can be noted that the columns with pen-
binders were still able to resist the peak load even after the concrete cover had 
spalled completely. At post-peak response, the load resistance of the tested 
column started to drop when bending and buckling of longitudinal 
reinforcement took place. A summary of the test results is presented in Table 2, 
which contains average values for two columns with identical test parameters.

5.2 Pen-binder Configuration 
The steel pen-binders in the specimens with non-code compliant confining 
reinforcement were able to prevent the hook from opening. Steel pen-binders in 
configuration D, E and F respectively were more effective in enhancing strength 
than those in configuration B (code compliant). Although it exhibits an increase 
in strength, the response of the column with configuration E in the high 
deformation range was not as good as that observed in the column with a code-
compliant confining reinforcement (Figure 8). The specimen with configuration 
F, which is simpler to install than configuration D, showed the best inelastic 
response, as it was able to sustain higher deformations. 
5.3 Pen-Binder Material 
Generally, it was observed that pen-binders made of steel were more effective 
in improving strength and ductility of confined columns than pen-binders made 
of plastic (Figure 9).  
 
Figure 9 shows that the configurations with a steel pen-binder gave a better 
performance than configurations with a plastic pen-binder. Only plastic pen-
binders with configuration D were found as effective as the column specimens 
confined with the code-compliant confining reinforcement. Figure 10 shows the 
test specimens after testing. Plastic pen-binders with configuration E failed to 
confine the concrete core effectively, as the confining reinforcement could not 
hold the expansion of the concrete core in the direction perpendicular to the 
pen-binder axis (Figure 10.c)

5.4 Comparison of Analytical and Experimental Results 
Several investigators have previously presented analytical stress-strain 
relationships for concrete confined by transverse reinforcement. Among these, 
the relations suggested by Sheikh and Uzumeri [12], Mander [13] and 
Saatcioglu and Razvi [6] will be studied to determine their applicability in 
simulating the test columns with various configurations. Figure 11 shows a 
comparison of the experimental and analytical curves for the specimen with 
configuration B (code-compliant). 
The model by Mander [13] and Sheikh Uzumeri [12] consistently overestimates 
the column axial stress capacities of the specimen with configuration B (Figure 
11). The model by Saatcioglu and Razvi [6] gave better results than the other 
models; it can be seen that the model accurately predicts the peak stress and the 
deterioration rate.  
Subsequently, the model by Saatcioglu and Razvi [6] was used to evaluate the 
confinement effectiveness of various pen-binder configurations. Confinement 
pressure along the side of the core for the various configurations can be 
determined by following the same procedure outlined previously.

compliantspecimen. 
The only difference is found in the value of sl, therefore, in this analytical study 
the pen-binder is assumed to be effective in providing lateral restraint to the 
confining reinforcement. Because of this, each configuration will have different 
k2 values corresponding to the position of the pen-binders in the confining 
reinforcement. Coefficient k2 reflects the efficiency of the reinforcement

arrangement and is equal to unity when the confining pressure is uniform as in 
the case of closely spaced circular spirals.  
Figure 12 illustrates lateral pressure distributions along the sides of a 
rectangular column with various pen-binder positions. Equivalent lateral 
pressure fle acting perpendicular to the core dimensions can be computed using 
Eq. (8) and Eq. (9). A comparison of the analytical and the experimental 
strength values is presented in Table 3. The results indicate good agreement 
between the analytical and the measured strength values.

configuration B, (b) configuration E, (c) configuration D, (d) configuration F. 
The k2valuefor various configurations in Table 3 indicates that the steel pen-
binders in configurations D,E and F, respectively, are more effective in 
improving concrete strength than columns with a code-compliant confining 
reinforcement (configuration B). 
Pen-binders with configurations D, E and F improve efficiency 28,6%, 20.7% 
and 41.3%, respectively, compared with a code-compliant configuration.

A stable confining reinforcement is essential to continuously provide effective 
confinement against the lateral expansion of the concrete beyond peak stress. 
Therefore the pen-binder plays an important role in holding the confining 
reinforcement, which will improve ductility significantly. The experimental 
results have been verified by comparing them with the stress-strain model of 
Saatcioglu and Razvi [6]. Figure 13 show a comparison of experimental and 
analytical curves for various configurations.

configurations. 
All the specimens produced a performance similar to the Saatcioglu and Razvi 
model, except for the specimen with configuration E. The difference between 
the experimental curve and the analytical curve of configuration Eat a large 
axial strain was quite significant. The cause of this discrepancy may be that the 
model of Saatcioglu and Razvi [6] is based on the assumption that a code-
compliant confining reinforcement is used, whereas configuration E is a column

two pen-binders. 
6 Conclusions 
The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of the experimental 
investigation of short columns subjected to a pure axial load reported in this 
paper: 
1. The use of pen-binders to hold a non-code compliant confining 
reinforcement improves strength and ductility of a concrete column very 
significantly. In general, the column specimens with a non-code compliant 
confining reinforcement plus pen-binders show better strength and ductility 
than column specimens with a code-compliant confining reinforcement. 
2. From the various configurations studied, the configuration with an 
additional pen-binder at a 90-degree hook zone in anon-code compliant 
hoop reinforcement (i.e. configuration D) shows the most desirable 
performance up to a significant deformation level. Pen-binders made of 
steel were found to be more effective in improving strength and ductility of 
reinforced concrete column sections than pen-binders made of plastic. 
3. The test results for various configurations have been verified extensively 
against analytical models and showed good correlations with the stress-
strain model of Saatcioglu and Razvi [6]. With this finding, it can be said 
that the use of pen-binders can effectively provide lateral restraint to the 
confining reinforcement at the location where they are installed.
