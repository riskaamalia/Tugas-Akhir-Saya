Abstract. One of the key issues in designing a network topology is vulnerability.  
The vulnerability parameter measures the resistance of a network to disruption of 
operation after the failure of certain stations or communication links. One 
counter-measure to address the vulnerability of a network is edge connectivity. 
In this paper, a more selective concept of edge connectivity is introduced, called 
component order edge connectivity for MAN topology design. This parameter 
equals the smallest number of edges that must be removed in order to ensure that 
the order of each component of the resulting sub-network or sub-graph is less 
than k.  
Keywords: edge connectivity; k-component edge connectivity; k-component edge-
failure set; k-component edge-failure state; minimum degree. 
1 Introduction 
A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that usually covers 
a city or a large campus, which has a geographic scope that falls between a wide 
area network (WAN) and a local area network (LAN). A MAN usually 
interconnects a number of nodes representing LANs that are interconnected 
using high-capacity backbone technology such as fiber optics, and provides up-
link services to WANs and the Internet. 
Some implementation technologies used for this purpose are the asynchronous 
transfer mode (ATM), the fiber distributed data interface (FDDI), and the 
switched multimegabit data service (SMDS). In most areas, these technologies 
are in the process of being displaced by ethernet-based connections (e.g., Metro 
Ethernet). MAN links between LANs have been built without cables using 
microwave, radio, or infrared laser links. Most companies rent or lease circuits 
from common carriers due to the fact that laying long stretches of cable can be 
expensive. 
Distributed-queue dual-bus (DQDB) is the metropolitan area network standard 
for data communication that is specified in the IEEE 802.6 standard. Using 
104 Antonius Suhartomo 
DQDB, networks can be up to 30 km long and operate at speeds up to 155 
Mbit/s.  
Point-to-point networking that supports MAN connections can be built based on 
network configurations such as a ÅgbusÅh network, a ÅgstarÅh network, a ÅgringÅh 
network, or a ÅgmeshÅh network. With the widespread dependence upon such 
networks, it becomes important to look for topologies that yield a high level of 
reliability and a low level of vulnerability to disruption. In this paper, the 
network configurations ÅgwheelÅh and ÅgfanÅh will be discussed.  
It is desirable to consider quantitative counter-measures to address a networkÅfs 
vulnerability when designing a MAN. In order to obtain such measures we 
model the network by a graph in which the station terminals are represented by 
the nodes of the graph and the links by the edges. In what follows, we assume G 
= (V, E), a simple graph where V is the non-empty set of nodes, and E is the set 
of edges. We use the notation ||)( VGn ?  for the order of the graph G and 
||)( EGe ?  for the size of the graph G. Unless specifically stated otherwise, we 
follow the standard graph theory notation found in [1].  
Definition 1. The edge-connectivity of G, denoted by )(G? or simply ? , is 
defined to be ? ?( )  min : ,  is an edge failure set .G F F E F? ? ?  [2] 
One drawback of the traditional edge-failure model is that the graph G ? F is an 
edge-failure state if it is disconnected and no consideration is given to whether 
or not there exists a ÅglargeÅh component that in itself may be viable.  
It is reasonable to consider a model in which it is not necessary that the 
surviving edges form a connected sub-network as long as they form a sub-
network with a component of some predetermined order. Therefore, we 
introduce a new edge-failure model, the k-component order edge-failure model. 
In this model, when a set of edges F fails we refer to F as a k-component edge-
failure set and the surviving sub-network G ? F as a k-component edge-failure 
state if G ? F contains no component of order at least k, where k is a 
predetermined threshold value.    
Definition 2. Let nk ??2  be a predetermined threshold value. The k-
component order edge-connectivity or component order edge connectivity 
of G, denoted by )()( Gkc?  or simply 
)(k
c? , is defined to be 
? ?set failure edgecomponent - is ,|:|min)()( kFEFFGkc ??? , i.e., all 
components of G ? F have order 1?? k  [3,4].  
 Alternative Design Topology for Metropolitan Area Network 105 
 
 
Definition 3. A set of edges F of graph G is 
)(k
c? -edge set if and only if it is a k-
component order edge-failure set and 
( )k
cF ??  [3-5].  
From this short explanation, we offer the option of networks or graphs in 
designing a MAN network topology with vulnerability issues by computing 
)()( Gkc?  for a specific type of graphs. 
2 Preliminary Results  
The following networks suggest which MAN topology is the best option 
regarding its degree of vulnerability. The first type of graph we consider is the 
cycle, nC . The formula for )(
)(
n
k
c C?  can be derived in a similar manner to that 
of )()( n
k
c P? [3]. When one edge of the cycle is removed, it becomes a path with 
n nodes, nP . Thus 1)()(

The second type of network that has been considered is the complete graph on n 
nodes, .nK Let ? ?nKEF ?  be a ?
)(k
c? edge set. We can compute |F| by 
calculating the maximum number of edges that can remain in the k-component 
edge-failure state .FKn ?  It is easy to see that any edge in F must have its 
endpoints in two different components of ;FKn ?  therefore each component 
of FKn ?  must itself be complete.

3 Main Results Model of Network Topology 
The preliminary results suggest the network topologies wheel and fan. Since we 
do not have a formula or an algorithm that computes )()( Gkc? of an arbitrary 
graph G representing the network, therefore we want to find bounds (both lower 
and upper) that may be applied to establish the range of possible values of 
)()( Gkc? . Before we introduce a set of bounds we need to establish some 
notation and terminology. 
First we consider the value of )()( Hkc? , where H is a sub-network of G but H is 
not spanning or connected. If H is a graph on m nodes, and m k? , then every 
component of H has order 1?? k , so it follows that 0)()( ?Hkc? . If H is 
disconnected and pHHH ,,, 21 ?  are the components of H, then

Definition 4.  If  EF ?  is a set of edges, G[F] denotes the sub-network of G 
with node set V and edge set F, i.e. G[F] = G ? (E ? F) [4].  
Definition 5. If U, VW ?  with },[,0 WUWU ??  denotes the set of all 
edges with one endpoint in U and the other endpoint in W [4]. 
The next theorem is the basis of our lower bound. 
Theorem 4. If 21 EE ?  is a partition of E, then 
? ? ? ? )(][][ )(2

Proof. Let D E?  be a )(kc? -edge set and let .2,1, ??? iDED ii  Since 
DEDE ii ??? , each component of ii DEG ?][  is contained in a 
component of G?D and therefore is of order 1?? k . It follows that

Thus we obtain the following lower bound:  
? ? ? ? )(][][ )(2

c ??? ?? , where 21 EE ?  is a partition of E. 
In particular if u is a node of full degree, then 
)()()1( )()( GuGkn kc
k
c ?? ????? . 
Now let VU ? be a set of nodes with |U| = k ? 1. We construct a k-component 
edge-failure set as follows: delete all edges that connect U to the rest of the 
graph, and then delete edges from UV ?  until all components have order < k 
? 1. Thus we obtain the following upper bound:  
? ?UVUVUG kckc ???? )()( ],[)( ?? , where VU ?  with |U| = k ? 1. 
We will apply these bounds to compute )()( Gkc? , when G is either nW , the 
wheel of order n, or nF , the fan of order n. 
Definition 6. The wheel of order n, nW , is the network or graph formed by 
connecting a single vertex to all the vertices of a 1?nC  [4].

Definition 7. The fan of order n, nF , is the graph formed by connecting a single 
vertex to all the vertices of a 1?nP  [4].  
                         
Figure 2 A fan graph, 
nF . 
Since the application of the bounds to nW  and nF  are done similarly, we will 
only demonstrate them for nW  and state the corresponding result for nF . 
Let G = nW  and let u be the full degree node. Then 1??? nCuG  and the lower 
bound implies

to isolate the full degree node u from the 1?nC , which means we must delete 
(n?1) additional edges. Hence we must remove at least 1??  edges from the

4 Conclusion 
The primary results discussed in [3] suggest investigation of new network 
models that make it possible to design aMAN network topology with the best 
solution for vulnerability issues.  
 Alternative Design Topology for Metropolitan Area Network 111 
 
When comparing network configurations with the same number of stations or 
nodes that need to be installed, a complete network is the best topology, but this 
makes it impossible to design a real MAN network. The cycle network is the 
simplest one in terms of installation, but it yields the worst results in terms of 
network vulnerability. We can see the comparison results in Table 1 below, 
which is based on the assumption that a MAN network is established with 10 
stations or nodes, while k = 4, 5 and 6, respectively.

configurations (cycle, complete, wheel and fan) with the same number of nodes.
