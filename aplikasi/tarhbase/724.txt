Abstract. A polymer electrolyte membrane widely used in PEMFCs and 
DMFCs is a perfluorosulfonated membrane (the Nafion membrane). This 
perfluorosulfonated membrane material exhibits good chemical stability and 
proton conductivity, but it is very expensive and difficult to recycle. There is a 
high methanol crossover in DMFCs that causes a decrease in efficiency and 
performance of the fuel cell, so that a polymer electrolyte membrane with a low 
methanol crossover is needed as a substitute for the Nafion membrane. One of 
the materials that can be used as a polymer electrolyte membrane is the 
polyblends from sulfonated polystyrene-lignosulfonate (SPS-LS). Such 
polyblends were prepared by casting a polymer solution and characterized as 
polyelectrolyte membrane for DMFCs. The SPS was prepared by sulfonation of 
polystyrene with acetyl sulfate as the sulfonating agent. The membranes of the 
SPS-LS were characterized by analysis of functional groups, mechanical 
properties and methanol permeability. The maximum mechanical properties of 
the SPS-LS membrane were observed at an LS ratio of 7.5%. However, the 
methanol permeability of the membrane increased with the increase of the LS 
ratio in the SPS-LS membranes. The properties of the membranes, especially 
their mechanical properties and methanol permeability, were close to that of 
Nafion? 117 membrane, so SPS-LS membranes have high potential for use as 
polymer electrolyte membrane for direct methanol fuel cells. 
Keywords: DMFC; lignosulfonate; polymer electrolyte membrane; polystyrene;

1 Introduction 
The need for energy increases with the growing population and improving 
living conditions of mankind, especially in transport, industry and households. 
The main source of energy is fossil fuels, which are non-renewable. Exploration 
286 Siang Tandi Gonggo, et al. 
of fossil fuels continuously causes the fossil-fuel reserves to diminish. The 
fossil fuel crisis has begun to be felt in society. According to S.M. Javaid Zaidi 
and Takeshi Matsuura [1], fossil-fuel production will peak in 2020 and 
thereafter decrease. In addition, continuous use of fossil fuels can cause serious 
environmental problems, such as global warming, climate change, melting of 
ice caps, acid rain, pollution, ozone layer depletion, forest and agricultural land 
damage, etc. [2]. Therefore, we need alternative energy sources that are 
environmentally friendly and renewable. One such environmentally and 
renewable energy source is the fuel cell.  
One type of fuel cell with potential as an energy source is the direct methanol 
fuel cell (DMFC), which uses methanol directly as a fuel. The DMFC, like any 
other fuel cell, consists of an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte. The 
electrolyte of the DMFC is a solid polymer membrane. The DMFC is very 
interesting because it operates at low temperatures and because of its potential 
use in automotive, stationary, portable power applications, etc [3].The most 
important part of a DMFC is the polymer membrane as the electrolyte, which is 
sandwiched between the electrodes (anode and cathode) to form the membrane 
electrode assembly (MEA), because the performance of the fuel cell is largely 
determined by the ability of the membrane to transfer protons. The ideal 
electrolyte membrane for a DMFC has high proton conductivity, no conducting 
electrons, good mechanical strength, thermal stability and chemical stability, no 
methanol permeability, highwater uptake above 100?C, and low production 
costs [1,4-6]. 
An electrolyte membrane commonly used for DMFCs is Nafion, due to its high 
proton conductivity, good thermal stability, chemical stability and mechanical 
strength [7-13]. However, this membrane is still quite expensive [7,13], and its 
conductivity decreases at higher temperatures and it shows high methanol 
permeability, which limits its application in DMFCs due to the consequent 
lowering of its efficiency. Therefore, polymer electrolyte membranes are 
needed that have properties as mentioned above. To get the ideal membrane is 
very difficult; if one of the criteria is met, a problem appears with another. This 
has caused the development of electrolyte membrane materials for DMFCÅfs to 
become the center of attention of researchers. In this paper, one of the new 
materials for DMFC membranes is presented, which is synthesized by blending 
sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) with lignosulfonate (LS) at various ratios. LS 
consists of sulfonate groups and also contains carboxylic groups (?COOH) [14], 
which may facilitate proton conductivity in the membrane. Polymer electrolyte 
membranes were prepared by blending sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) with 
lignosulfonate (LS) in various ratios by casting a polymer solution. Properties 
of the membranes, such as the mechanical properties and methanol 
permeability, were measured.

2 Materials and Methods 
2.1 Materials 
The materials used in this research,i.e. polystyrene (PS) (??     = 140.000 g/mol) 
and lignosulfonate acid (??    = 7.000 g/mol), were obtained commercially from 
Aldrich.  Sulfuric acid (95-97%), acetic anhydride (Synth, p.a.), 
dichloromethane (DCM), 2-propanol, NaOH (Vetec), methanol, N,N-dimethyl 
formamide (DMF), toluene, and n-butanol were commercially obtained from 
Merck. 
2.2 Methods 
The sulfonation of the polystyrene (PS) was prepared by the following 
procedure [15,16]. First, acetyl sulfate was freshly prepared for use as the 
sulfonating reagent: 12 ml acetic anhydride was added to 24 ml 
dichloromethane (DCM) in a three-neck tube under a nitrogen atmosphere. The 
volume of the DCM was twice that of the acetic anhydride. The solution was 
cooled at about 0?C, then 6 ml sulfuric acid (95-97%) in stoichiometric amount 
to the desired degree of sulfonation in the polymer was added into solution 
under a nitrogen atmosphere. The molar amount of acetic anhydride was added 
in slight excess to the sulfuric acid, so that the latter was completely converted 
to acetyl sulfate. Finally, the three-neck tube was capped, and the acetyl sulfate 
resulted in DCM solution was ready to be used. The equipment that was used in 
this synthesis is illustrated in Figure1. 
21 g of atactic polystyrene (PS) was dissolved in 210 mL of DCM, which had 
previously been purged with nitrogen in a flask. The solution was maintained 
under nitrogen and then heated to 40?C. The total amount of the prepared acetyl 
sulfate solution was added into the flask, and sulfonation was carried out for 80 
minutes understirring. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mL of 2-propanol 
and the resulting solution was cooled at room temperature.  The sulfonated 
polymer was then precipitated in 1 L of distilled water at a temperature of about 
80?C. The polymer was filtered, washed for 2 h with distilled water at room 
temperature, and then filtered again. Finally, the sulfonated polymer was dried 
under vacuum at 60?C for two days. 
2.3 Preparation of Membranes 
A solution (1.5 g/20 mL) of the sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) in a toluene/n-
butanol mixture (7/3 v/v) [15, 16] was poured into a petri dish and placed in a 
vacuum oven at room temperature until the solvent had completely evaporated. 
Then, the temperature was risen to 50?C and the membrane was vacuum-dried 
further for one hour. Finally, the membrane was recovered as a sheet membrane 
288 Siang Tandi Gonggo, et al. 
from the petri dish and soaked in distilled water for 3 h, before being tested. The 
membrane thickness was measured in the hydrated state by micrometer. For 
preparing the sulfonated polystyrene-lignosulfonate, the SPS was dissolved into 
a mixture of toluene/n-butanol (7/3 v/v), and the LS was dissolved in N,N-
dimethyl formamide (DMF) with various concentrations. Both solutions were a 
mixture of toluene/n-butanol to DMF of 4/1 (v/v), and the solutions were stirred 
until homogeneous. The solutions were then cast onto a petri dish like the SPS 
membranes mentioned above, and finally the membranes were kept in distilled 
water.

2.4 Analysis of Functional Groups 
The FTIR spectra of the SPS-LS membranes were characterized using a FTIR 
spectrometer (Shimadzu IR PRESTIGE-21). The samples were prepared using 
KBr pellets. The FTIR spectra of the SPS-LS powders were taken at wave 
numbers in the range of 400 to 4500 cm
-1
.

2.5 Analysis of Mechanical Properties 
The mechanical strength of the membranes was measured by an Instron testing 
machine (Japan) with an operating head load of 50 N. The cross-sectional area 
of the samples was calculated. The membranes were then placed between the 
grips of the testing machine. The grip length was 4 cm, and the speed of testing 
was set at a rate of 50 mm/min [17]. The Young modulus was calculated 
according to Eq. (1) [16].

2.6 Analysis of Methanol Permeability 
Methanol permeability measurement was carried out using a diffusion cell. 
Initially, one compartment of the cell, B (VB = 100 mL), was filled with only 
deionized water. The other compartment, A (VA = 100 mL), was filled with 5 M 
methanol solution in deionized water. The membrane with a diffusion area of 
1.77 cm

 was sandwiched by O-ring shaped Teflon and was clamped tightly 
between the two compartments, as illustrated in Figure 2.

This diffusion cell was kept stirring slowly during the experiment. The 
concentration of methanol diffusing from compartment A to compartment B 
290 Siang Tandi Gonggo, et al. 
across the membrane was detected every time using Gas Chromatography (GC). 
The methanol concentration in compartment B was calculated according to Eq.

Where CB and CA are the methanol concentrations in the permeated 
compartment and the feed compartment, respectively. A, L and VB are the 
effective area of the membrane, the thickness, and the volume of the permeated 
compartment, respectively. D, K, and (t-t0) are the methanol diffusion, the 
partition coefficient between the membrane and the adjacent solution, and the 
time interval, respectively. The methanol permeability is defined as the product 
of diffusion and solubility (DK), and the concentration change of CB with time 
is obtained from a linear slope, using Eq. (3).

3 Results and Discussion 
The preparation of the SPS-LS membranes with various concentrations of LS 
(2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 % (w/w)) having been performed successfully, they 
were called SPS-LS2.5, SPS-LS5, SPS-LS7.5, SPS-LS10, and SPS-LS12.5, 
respectively. The polymer membranes were characterized extensively by 
analysis of functional groups (FTIR), mechanical properties (Tensile tester), and 
methanol permeability. 
The FTIR spectra of the sulfonated polystyrene (SPS), the lignosulfonate (LS), 
and the SPS-LS are presented in Figure 3. The spectra of the SPS show 
absorption peaks at 1165-1180 and 1032 cm
-1
, indicating symmetric stretching 
vibrations of the aromatic ?SO3H.The increased sharpness of the absorption 
peak at 831 cm
-1
 shows the attachment of sulfonic acid groups at para position 
[18,19]. The peak identified at 1363 cm
-1
 is due to the asymmetric stretching of 
the S=O bond. The symmetric vibration of this bond produces the characteristic 
peak split of absorbance at 1150-1185 cm
-1
 [16, 18]. Additionally, the 
absorption peak at 3450 cm
-1
 is attributed to vibration of ?OH from the 
?SO3H group. 
The FTIR spectra of the SPS-LS membranes are shown in Figure 3. Compared 
to the spectra of the SPS and the lignosulfonate (LS), the absorption peaks of 
the SPS-LS membrane are a combination of the absorption peaks of the SPS 
and the LS. The presence of absorption peaks at 3500 cm

symmetric alkene in SPS and LS, and C=O stretching in LS molecular, 
respectively. They refer to the phenolic hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups of 
the LS [20]. These FTIR absorption peaks reveal that the LS was incorporated 
into the SPS.

One of the most important evaluations for a proton exchange membrane (PEM) 
is the analysis of its mechanical properties. In this work, the Young modulus of 
the SPS and the SPS-LS membranes were performed on an Instron tensile tester 
with a strain speed of 50 mm/min. Tensile strength and elongation at an elastic 
state of all membranes were evaluated at room temperature in fully hydrated 
states, of which the results are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that all 
membranes exhibited high Young modulus ranging from 414.41 to 610.25 MPa.

Addition of LS into the SPS membrane can increase the mechanical strength. 
This is caused by the presence of high cross-linking of LS [20], which can 
292 Siang Tandi Gonggo, et al. 
improve the membraneÅfs mechanical strength. However, at a high weight ratio 
of LS, the Young modulus for the membranes decreases. The excessive LS can 
form a layer on the surface and disturb the membrane surface, especially 
through the formation of larger pores. This result was reported in a previous 
paper [21]. On the other hand, the elongation of the membrane increases with 
increasing LS content in the membranes. 
Besides proton conductivity, the methanol permeability is one of the most 
important parameters for electrolyte membranes, particularly for the 
development of DMFC technology. The methanol permeability or methanol 
cross-over is a phenomenon of absorption of methanol as a fuel from the anode 
chamber through the membrane into the cathode chamber. Methanol cross-over 
in a DMFC can occur through diffusion and electro osmotic drag (EOD). 
According to David P. Wilkinson, et al., 2010 [22], methanol cross-over is 
strongly influenced by the structure, morphology, thickness, acid group 
contents, temperature and concentration of the methanol used. Methanol 
permeability is reduced by using a thicker membrane material or using an 
equivalent weight of polymer membranes with a high. The ideal electrolyte 
membrane for a DMFC has no methanol cross-over, but it can transport water to 
the cathode to prevent drying of the cathode catalyst layer. Because of the 
similar properties of water and methanol it is difficult to separate methanol 
transport from water transport in the DMFC, which could be done to minimize 
methanol permeability. Analysis of methanol cross-over of the SPS-LS has been 
performed by a diffusion cell. Methanol cross-over analysis has been done on 
the SPS-LS-LS2.5, SPS-LS7.5, and SPS-LS12.5. The results of the calculation 
ranged from 2.06 x 10
-6
 to 2.15 x 10
-6
 cm/s. The methanol permeability profile 
is shown in Figure 4. The methanol cross-over of Nafion? 117 with the same 
treatment and measurement conditions is 2.08 x 10
-6
 cm/s. 
Figure 4 shows that the methanol permeability increased as the LS ratio in the 
membranes increased. An increase of LS content in the SPS-LS membrane can 
increase the sulfonate (?SO3H) and carboxylic (?COOH) groups in the 
membranes, so the hydrophilic property of the membranes also increases, as 
shown in the FTIR spectra, and this property can increase the proton 
conductivity and water uptake of the membranes [21], which supports methanol 
to pass through the membrane. However, the methanol cross-over value of SPS-
LS7.5 is similar to that of a Nafion? 117 membrane under the same 
measurement conditions. Based on the physicochemical properties of the 
membranes, especially the mechanical properties, methanol permeability and 
also proton conductivity [21], being close to that of a Nafion? 117 membrane, 
this membrane is potentially useful for DMFC application.

4 Conclusion 
A new type of electrolyte membrane material for DMFCs has been prepared by 
blending SPS with LS through casting a polymer solution. The SPS-LS 
membranes show maximum tensile strength and Young modulus at an LS ratio 
of 7.5%. However, the presence of LS in the membranes can increase the 
methanol cross-over of the membranes. The properties of the membrane, 
especially the mechanical properties and methanol permeability, are close to 
those of the Nafion
?
 117 membrane, so this membrane is potentially useful for 
DMFC application.
