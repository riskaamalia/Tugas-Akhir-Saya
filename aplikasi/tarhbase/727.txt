Abstract. Suppose that a time series model is fitted. It is likely that the fitted 
model is not the true model. In other words, the model has been misspecified. In 
this paper, we consider the prediction interval problem in the case of a 
misspecified first-order autoregressive or AR(1) model. We have calculated the 
coverage probability of an upper one-step-ahead prediction interval for both 
properly specified and misspecified models through Monte Carlo simulation. It 
was found that dealing with prediction interval for misspecified model is 
complicated: the distribution of a future observation conditional on the last 
observation and the parameter estimator is not identical to the distribution of this 
future observation conditional on the last observation alone. 
Keywords: autoregressive; coverage probability; model misspecification; time series 
prediction.  
1 Introduction 
A very informative way of specifying the accuracy of a time series prediction is 
to use a prediction interval. To do this, some authors, e.g. [1-5], have computed 
the prediction interval or limit for the autoregressive (AR) process and the 
autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) process. For these models, 
they have assumed that the fitted model is the true model. In other words, the 
authors have employed properly specified models. 
In practice, however, time series models are likely to be misspecified. For 
instance, an AR(1) model is fitted but the true model is an AR(2) or MA(1) 
model. This paper deals with the prediction interval in the case of a misspecified 
AR(1) model. In the context of the prediction problem, there have been a few 
papers, such as [6] and [7], that provide derivations of expressions for mean-
squared-error of prediction in the case of a misspecified Gaussian AR(p) model. 
An investigation of the coverage probability, conditional on the last 
observations, of a prediction interval based on a misspecified Gaussian AR(p) 
model was presented first by [8]. 
In the case of a misspecified Gaussian AR(p ) model, the derivation of the 
asymptotic expansion of the coverage probability, conditional on the last 
218 Khreshna Syuhada 
observations, of a prediction interval requires a great deal of care. To make 
clear the issues involved in this derivation, we consider the simple scenario 
described in Section 2. Namely, a misspecfied zero-mean Gaussian AR(1) 
process fitted to a stationary zero-mean Gaussian process. We also consider a 
one-step-ahead prediction interval with target coverage probability. Similarly to 
[8], we aim to find the asymptotic expansion for the coverage probability of the 
prediction interval under consideration, conditional on the last observation. 
In Section 3, we compute the conditional coverage probabilities for both 
properly and misspecified first order autoregressive models. This is aimed to 
examine the effect of misspecification on the coverage probability of the 
prediction interval. Furthermore, the technical argument for finding the 
conditional coverage probability of a prediction interval as proposed by de Luna 
(which differs from the estimative prediction interval) is reviewed in detail in 
Section 4. A numerical example to illustrate a gap in his argument is given in 
Section 5. 
2 Description of the Time Series and Fitted Models 
Consider a discrete time stationary Gaussian zero-mean process }{ tY . Let

process. The available data are nYYY ,,, 21 ? . We will be careful to distinguish 
between random variables, written in upper case, and their observed values, 
written in lower case. 
We consider one-step-ahead prediction using a stationary Gaussian zero-mean 
AR(1) model. This model may be misspecified. Let 0/= ??? kk . Define ?  to

( 0>b ). 
3 The Coverage Properties of Misspecified AR(1) Model 
In this section, we examine the effect of misspecification on the coverage 
probability of the prediction interval. The true model }{ tY  is a zero-mean 
Gaussian AR(2) process, satisfying  
 1 1 2 2=t t t tY Y Y? ? ?? ?? ?  (1) 
for all integer t , where t?  are independent and identically )(0,
2?N  
distributed. The roots of 
2
211 mm ?? ??  are outside the unit circle to ensure 
stationarity of the process. 
We consider an upper one-step-ahead prediction interval with conditional mean 
square prediction error equal to 2V , i.e.

process backwards in time.

Table 1 presents the estimate of conditional coverage probability (3). Standard 
errors of these estimates are given in brackets. We also provide the estimate of 
conditional coverage probability of when the predictor is also a zero-mean 
Gaussian AR(2) model (properly specified model) as in [4]. 
4 The Conditional Distribution for Misspecified Model 
de Luna (2000) considers the data generating mechanism }{ tY , as described 
earlier, and h -step-ahead prediction using a zero-mean Gaussian AR( p ) 
model. This model may be misspecified. Consider the case that 1=h  and 
1=p . His ??1  prediction interval for 1?nY  is

?
?  and /21 ??z  is the 
/2)(1 ??  quantile of the (0,1)N  distribution. In practice, 
2?  and w  are 
unknown since they depend on an unknown autocovariance function of the 
process }{ tY . However, de Luna assumes that both 
2?  and w  are known. 
de Luna claims that )(1=)=|( 11
?

this claim, with intermediate steps added, is the following.

by the double expectation theorem. To evaluate this conditional expectation, de 
Luna proceeds as follows. Define )(?F  and )(?f  to be the cdf and pdf of 1?nY  
conditional on nn yY = , respectively. He then assumes that  
 
2 2

The assumption (5) is crucial. It is true if { }tY  is also an AR(1) process (i.e. if 
the model is properly specified), but it is not necessarily true if the model is 
misspecified. Let 
Åı ?( ; )F ??  denote the cdf of 1nY ?  conditional on =n nY y  and 
?=??

If }{ tY  is also an AR(1) process then, by the Markov property, )(=)
?;(Åı ?? FF ?  
and so (5) is satisfied. If, however, the model is misspecified then )?;(Åı ??F  is 
not necessarily equal to )(?F . 
5 Computational Example to Illustrate the Error in the 
Calculating Conditional Distribution 
In this section, we provide a numerical example to support the following 
argument. For a misspecified AR(1) model, the distribution of 1?nY  conditional 
on nn yY =  is not identical to the distribution of 1?nY  conditional on nn yY =  
and ??=
?
? . In doing so, we seek an estimator 
?
? , an observed value ??  
and a misspecified AR(1) model such that the condition ??=
?
? , when added 
to the condition nn yY = , tells us a great deal more about the value of 1?nY  than 
the condition nn yY =  alone. 
Consider the following estimator:

6 Discussion 
The derivation of the asymptotic conditional coverage probability for a 
misspecified model requires a great deal more care than the derivation of the 
asymptotic conditional coverage probability for a properly specified model. 
Results similar to those of de Luna can be derived by defining the random 
variable 1 1 1 1= ( | , , )n n n n nX E X X X? ? ? ? ?? ?  and noting that 1?n?  and 
),,( 1??nn XX  are independent random vectors.
