Abstract. The magnetic states of Cobalt ions in magnetic thermoelectric 
materials of Bi1.5Pb0.5Ca2-zYzCo2O8 (z = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) have been studied 
from the structural (X-ray diffraction) and magnetic susceptibility data. The 
misfit structure was revealed from refinement of the XRD data, with reduction of 
the lattice parameters while increasing the Y doping content. Compared with the 
(Bi,Pb)2Sr2Co2O8 parent compound system, the lattice parameter c was reduced 
significantly, while the misfit degree remained almost the same. The analysis of 
the magnetic data shows that the Cobalt ions are coupled antiferromagnetically 
within the CoO2 layers, with the existence of mixed valence states between Co
3+ 
and Co4+ ions. Besides that, the effective magnetic moments of Cobalt ions are 
almost constant along the Y doping content. Assuming the orbital quenching as 
commonly found in most transition metal ions, the data are best fitted by taking 
the low-spin state of Co3+ ions and intermediate spin state of Co4+ ions. We argue 
qualitatively, that the spin-state transition across the gap are induced by the 
shrinkage of the charge transfer energy gaps between O 2p and Co ge  levels due 
to reduction of the ionic spaces between Co and O ions. 
Keywords: antiferromagnetic; mixed valence states; spin state; thermoelectric 
materials.  
1 Introduction 
A large number of the transition metal oxides have been found to exhibit unique 
behaviors such as the high temperature superconductivity discovered in Cu-
based oxides, the colossal magnetoresistance observed in Mn-based oxides, and 
the giant thermoelectric effect found in Co-based oxide compounds. These 
unusual and highly promising functional properties have been widely 
understood to have their origins in the intricate interplays among the spin, 
orbital and charge degrees of freedom in the strongly correlated d-electron 
system of the associated transition metal ions [1,2]. A rich variety of layered 
structures is known in these compounds. The compounds generally show, upon 
appropriate doping, the occurrence of multivalence of oxidation states 
 Magnetic States of the Co-ions in Ca and Y Doped 231 
 
associated with different electron configuration of the d-orbitals, which are 
supposed to be largely responsible for the observed properties [3].  
Following the discovery of a large thermoelectric power (100 ?V/K) at 300 K in 
NaCo2O4 [4], the Bi2Sr2Co2Ox compound [5] as well as its Pb doped species 
[6,7] have become the object of considerable research interest. These 
compounds have been shown to offer potentially even larger thermoelectric 
power ? ???2S  at about the same elevated temperature, due to the increased 
Seebeck coefficient (S) and the decrease of electric resistivity (?) with 
increasing temperatures [5-7]. The hole doping induced by the partial 
substitution of the trivalent Bi
3+
 by the divalent Pb
2+
 is supposed to be related to 
the further enhancement of the thermoelectric performance of the doped 
compound. These compounds have also been found to feature a misfit-layer 
structure and the Co
3+?Co4+ mixed-valence states [8]. Subsequently, the thermal 
conductivity (?) measurement of the Pb-doped compounds was performed, both 
for the in-plane [9] and out-of-plane [10] directions, showing significantly 
lower ? for the latter due to the strong phonon scattering by the lattice misfit. In 
the mean time an X-ray absorption study of the (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Co-O compounds 
further indicated the presence of Co
3+?Co4+ mixed-valence states with 62gt  and 
5
2gt  low-spin configurations, respectively [11], in agreement with the very small 
magnetic moment of about B?1.0  [12]. 
In subsequent efforts to further explore new thermoelectric materials, both 
(Bi,Pb)-Sr-Co-O and (Bi,Pb)-Ca-Co-O compounds with additional doping of 
trivalent Y, and other trivalent elements (Sc,La), were reported to exhibit 
favorable temperature dependent electric transport behaviors [13,14]. However, 
no explicit information was offered on the spin state of Co
3+
 and Co
4+
. In this 
experiment we focused on the Y-doped (Bi,Pb)-Ca-Co-O compound and the 
analysis of the Co ions spin states on the basis of the magnetization data.  
2 Experiment 
The magnetic thermoelectric materials of Bi1.5Pb0.5Ca2-zYzCo2O8 (z = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 
and 0.3) have been prepared from precursors of Bi2O3, PbO, SrCO3, CaCO3, 
Y2O3 and Co3O4 by a conventional solid-state reaction method. The precursors 
were pulverized by ball milling for several hours, followed by calcination in air 
at a temperature of about 800 ÅãC for 10 hours. After being ground carefully and 
mixed well, the powders were pressed into pellets and finally sintered in air at a 
temperature of about 840 ÅãC for 12 hours. The XRD measurements were done 
using standard CuK? radiation from a Philips machine. The magnetic 
232 Inge M. Sutjahja & A. Agung Nugroho 
susceptibility measurements were performed using PPMS in the ZFC mode 
with an applied field of 1000 Oe in a temperature range between 5 and 300 K.   
3 Results and Analysis 
The results of the XRD measurement of the Bi1.5Pb0.5Ca2-zYzCo2O8 
polycrystalline samples with z = 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 are shown in Figure 1. 
Structural analysis or refinement of the XRD data was performed using the 
Rietica 2007 program. Assuming the misfit structure like in the case of the 
undoped Bi2Sr2Co2O8 parent compound [15], the data were fitted using a 
monoclinic structure with space group C2/C and two-phase parameters for the 
rocksalt and CoO2 sublattices. The results show that the misfit character of the 
structure was revealed by the difference between the lattice parameters b1 and b2 
that belong to the two sublattices. We found that with an increasing z value 
some additional peaks occur that cannot be refined, which might be due to some 
impurity phases.

Table 1 shows the evolution of lattice parameters a, b1, b2, c, and the ? angle 
with respect to z. We note that except for the z = 0.3 samples, which contain 
some impurity phases, the lattice parameters a, b1, b2, and c tend to decrease 
with an increasing z value, in agreement with the smaller ionic radii of the Y
3+
 
ion compared to the Ca
2+
 ion. One can remark that the ? angle has increased 
with increasing Y content, while the value of b2/b1 that measures the degree of 
the misfit structure is approximately equal to 0.537.

Apparently no sign of magnetic transition is observed in the temperature range 
down to about 5 K. We note that the nonmonotonous value of ? with Y doping 
is clearly visible in this figure. The associated T??1?  curves are presented in 
Figure 1(b). It is seen that the high temperature part (T > 200 K) of the data that 
show straight lines, obeys the Curie-Weiss law

susceptibility (? ?1) versus temperature. The lines are the linear fit of the high-
temperature part of the data.  
From analysis of the data using Eqs.(1) and (2) we found that both the values of 
C and eff?  vary nonmonoutonously with z. Indeed, the negative values of the 
Weiss constant ? give the sign for the antiferromagnetic interaction of the Co 
ions in the CoO2 plane. The plot of eff?  versus z, as depicted in Figure 3, shows 
an almost constant value along the doping content. We note that this behavior is 
somewhat different from that reported by Iguchi, et al. [13], performed on 
 Magnetic States of the Co-ions in Ca and Y Doped 235 
 
similar samples, although they didnÅft reported the exact value. Despite of this 
fact, we note also that in general the resulted effective magnetic moment values 
are smaller than the effective moment of the free ions, namely B?70,6  for Co
3+
 
ions and B?92,5  for Co
4+
 ions [16]. Based on this finding we argue the 
importance of the crystal field effect in this system, as commonly found in 
transition metal oxide compounds. Due to this effect, the 5-fold degenerate 3d 
orbitals of the Co ions will split into gt2  and ge  orbitals with orbital energy 
levels of gt2  lower than the ge  orbital, due to the fact that the Co ions are in the 
octahedral electrostatic field of oxygen ions with symmetry hO . In addition, the 
competition between the repulsive interaction energy of electrons U (HundÅfs 
rule coupling) and the crystal field splitting ? ?qD10?? will determine the 
population distribution of the 3d electrons in the gt2  and ge  orbitals. Hence, 
three different spin-states are denoted, low-spin (LS), intermediate-spin (IS), 
and high-spin (HS), according to the resulted total spin value (S). For instance, 
Co
3+
 ions with a 
63d  configuration can in principle exist in low-spin state (LS: 
6
2gt , S = 0), intermediate-spin state (IS: 
15
2 gget , S = 1), and high-spin state (HS: 
24
2 gget , S = 2). On the other hand, Co
4+
 ions in a 
53d  configuration can also exist 
in LS state ( 52gt , S = 1/2), IS state (
14
2 gget , S = 3/2), or HS state (
23
2 gget , S = 5/2).

Subsequently, we fitted the experimental data of the effective magnetic moment 
with the theoretical values, assuming the different spin-state configurations of 
the Co
3+
 and Co
4+
 ions. Hence the theoretical eff?  can be calculated according 
to the formula [16]

where J is the total spin quantum number and g = 2 is the LandeÅfs g factor. 
Assuming the orbital quenching as commonly found for most transition metal 
ions, the total spin quantum number J is equal to the total spin S, according to 
the formula [8,17] 
 ? ? 43pins 2 zSSzSJ ????  (4) 
where 3S  and 4S  represent the spin of the Co
3+
 and Co
4+
 ions, respectively. As 
shown as a solid line in Figure 3, we found that the experimental result is best 
fitted by assuming the LS spin state of the Co
3+
 ions and the IS spin state of the 
Co
4+
 ions. 
At this point, it is important to compare our results with those of the 
(Bi,Pb)2Sr2Co2Oy parent compound system in order to investigate the doping 
effect [18]. From a structural point of view, the effect of Ca and Y doping leads 
to a significant reduction of lattice parameter c in the present system, due to the 
smaller ionic radii of the Ca
2+
 ions compared to the Sr
2+
 ions, although the 
misfit degree almost keeps the same value. The magnetic spin states of the Co
3+
 
and Co
4+
 ions in the parent compound system are both low-spin, as deduced 
from the magnetic data [18] and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) 
measurement results [11]. Based on the correlation study, we argue qualitatively 
that in the Ca and Y doped (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Co2Oy thermoelectric materials the 
decrease in lattice parameter c leads to a reduction of the ionic spaces between 
the Co and O ions, and leads to a shrinkage of the charge transfer energy gaps 
between the O 2p and Co ge  levels. This phenomenon can induce the spin-state 
transition across the gap. We further note that additional measurements of XAS 
and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) are important to clarify the 
abovementioned analysis.  
4 Conclusion 
In this paper, the effects of Ca and Y doping on the (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Co2O8 parent 
compound have been investigated from the analysis of the structural and 
magnetization data. Besides the misfit structure, the shrinkage of the lattice is

magnetic moment value of the Co-ions is almost constant toward the doping 
content and they are much smaller than the free ion values. Further analysis on 
the basis of the crystal field and the effect of quenching the orbital moment 
shows that the Co-ions persist in mixed valence states and different spin states,
