Abstract. A series of tris(É¿-diketonato)zirconium(IV) complexes was 
immobilized into a synthetic clay structure of Taeniolite by an ion-exchange 
method to generate organic/inorganic hybrid compounds. The hybrid compound 
served as a good catalyst for ring-opening reactions of methyl, ethyl, and 
dimethyl oxiranes with various alcohols to generate primary alkoxy alcohols in 
appreciable selectivity. This method describes a technique to immobilize cationic 
zirconium complexes without losing selectivity. 
Keywords: É¿-alkoxyalcohols; oxiranes; ring-opening; Taeniolite; tris(É¿-
diketonato)zirconium. 
1 Introduction 
É¿-Alkoxyalcohols are versatile precursors in organic synthesis and 
pharmaceuticals. The synthetic route for such compounds commonly proceeds 
via ring-opening of oxiranes (epoxides) [1-24] using traditional Lewis acids 
such as Cu(BF4)2 [2,21], Sn(OTf)2 [11], BF3 [22], Sc(OTf)3 [24], and traditional 
solid acids such as amberlyst-15 [10]. Modified Lewis acid complexes based on 
salen [5,12] and porphyrin [23] ligands have also been reported. Some 
heterogeneous catalysts such as zeolites [1,18], monmorillonite K-10 [4], silica 
gel [6], mesoporous aluminosilicate [9,12,14,15,20], CuO/SiO2 [19], and 
sulphated yttria-zirconia [25] have been reported as catalysts in the ring-opening 
of oxiranes. An alternative reaction method using a microwave technique has 
also been examined [13], even though such a method still experiences 
difficulties in scale-up processes. In continuation of our research on oxirane 
ring-opening reactions [3,7,8] we report herein a new methodology for oxirane 
ring-opening using clay-supported Zr(IV) diketonates. The clay selected as a 
host was lithium Taeniolite, denoted as Li-TN [26]. Lewis acidity at the metal 
center in the complex was improved by utilization of phenyl and fluoro diketone 
ligands and was observed from its homogeneous state [7,8]. We have previously 
discussed an immobilization effect of a zirconium complex into clays [3,8] and 
observed the enhancement in catalytic activities likely due to a desolvation 
264 Yessi Permana, et.al. 
phenomenon of metal complexes in clay layers [27,28]. We have also observed 
a selectivity enhancement when a zirconium complex was immobilized into 
Taeniolite and natural Bentonite, which was possibly due to constrained clay 
layers (the clays were notably swollen poorly in alcohols) [3]. In this work, we 
found that the trend in the selectivity of the heterogeneous catalysts was, unlike 
that of the homogeneous catalysts, independent on the functional groups of 
ligands, and the activity of the heterogeneous catalysts was dependent on the 
size of the substrate. Nevertheless, the effort to immobilize tris(É¿-
diketonato)zirconium(IV) into clay is still important, regardless of common 
requisites of selectivity and activity, as such efforts may provide an alternative 
method to prepare a robust and easily separable ionic zirconium catalyst for 
liquid phase reactions.

Scheme 1 Immobilization of Zr(IV) É¿-diketonates into Taeniolite layers. 
2 Experiment 
2.1 Materials and Reagents   
Zirconium tetrachloride, É¿-diketone ligands, oxiranes and alcohols were 
purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. and used without prior 
treatment. The synthetic Lithium Taeniolite (Li[(Mg2Li)(Si4O10)F2]) used in this 
work was kindly supplied by Topy Industry Co. Ltd., Japan. Complexes of 
2b?d and 2a/TN catalyst were prepared as in our previous report [3,8].    
2.2 Preparation of Taeniolite Supported Tris(É¿-Diketonato) 
Zirconium 
The 2b?d/TN catalysts were prepared in the following, slightly different 
manner.  Lithium Taeniolite (cation exchange capacity, C.E.C, of 2.68 mmol 
Li
+
/g Taeniolite) of 0.1 g was swollen by deionized water (10 ml). Complexes 
2b and 2c (50% of Taeniolite C.E.C) were dissolved in methanol (30 ml), and 
2d (50% of Taeniolite C.E.C) in acetone (30 ml). The solution was added to the 
Ring-opening of Oxiranes using Tris(É¿-Diketonato)Zr/Taeniolite 265 
 
swollen Taeniolite, followed by stirring at 35 ÅãC for 48 h and sonication for 1.5 
h. Complex/Taeniolite compounds were characterized using PXRD (Bruker 
AXS MXP3V; Cu-K?) and FT-IR (JEOL JIR-7000). The amount of loaded 
complexes was examined by calculating the remained concentration of 
complexes in the filtrate after ion-exchange using a simple UV-Vis technique 
(Shimadzu UV-2101PC).  
2.3 Ring-Opening Reactions of Oxiranes with Alcohols 
Methyl, ethyl and dimethyl oxiranes (3.55 mmol), respectively, were added into 
methanol in excess (10 ml), containing 1 mol% of active species of 2a?d/TN 
catalysts.  In another series of reactions, methyl oxirane (3.55 mmol) was added 
to methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and i-propanol, respectively, in excess (10 ml), 
containing 1 mol% of active species of 2a/TN catalyst. Reaction condition was 
24 h, 60 ÅãC and 1 atm. The products were analyzed by GC (Rt É¿-DEXsa 
column) and GC-MS (Rt É¿-DEXsm column). 
3 Results and Discussion 
3.1 Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Compounds  
Tris(É¿-diketonato)zirconium(IV) complexes have been immobilized into clay 
structure by a facile ion exchange method (Scheme 1), affording a series of 
organic/inorganic hybrid compounds (2a?d/TN). The immobilization of the 
complexes was confirmed by FT-IR, powder XRD, and UV-Vis analysis. XRD 
patterns of the compounds (Figure 1) showed a shift of initial d001 reflection to 
lower angles, demonstrating an expansion of clay layers due to a complex 
immobilization. Unlike the 2a/TN catalyst, the 2b?d/TN catalysts revealed a 
relatively weaker shift towards lower angles despite their theoretically bigger 
molecular size than 2a. Such a poor layer expansion will affect substrate 
diffusion adversely during a catalytic reaction. However, in contrast to 2a/TN, 
good crystallinity was observed in the case of immobilized 2b?d (Figure 1). 
This may indicate a fair distribution of complexes 2b?d in interstitial layers of 
Taeniolite. 
The amount of immobilized complexes on Taeniolite was measured by UV-Vis 
analysis of the filtrate after ion-exchange processes and provided in mmol/g of 
Taeniolite. Loading amounts and PXRD parameters of Taeniolite layers after 
immobilization are presented in Table 1.

The loading amount data tell us that the complex substituted about 40% of the 
lithium host cations. Although no experiment intended to vary the feeding 
amount to see the influence on catalysis, all reactions conducted in this work 
employed the same amount of Zr complexes, i.e. 1 mol% of exchanged 
complexes, and thus a difference in activity due to a feeding amount parameter 
should be eliminated.

idealized 2:1 (Tetrahedral?Octahedral?Tetrahedral) structure. C.S. = clearance 
space of interlayer. Large black balls are oxygen; large grey balls are fluorine; 
small black balls are silicon; small white balls are magnesium.  
The appearance of characteristic bond vibrations of tris(É¿-diketonato)zirconium, 
i.e. ?C(arom)-H, ?C(sp2)-H, and ?C=O, in IR spectra of Taeniolite supported 
complexes clearly confirmed the presence of the complexes on the Taeniolite 
structure (Figure 2). There are two possible causes for the complexesÅf 
immobilization on clay. First, the complexes were immobilized in their salt 
forms (cations and anions were being incorporated into clay layers), and second, 
only cations were immobilized through an ion-exchange process with 
exchangeable lithium cations. Confirmatory evidence that cationic tris(É¿-
diketonato)zirconium complexes successfully exchanged lithium host cations 
was observed from vibration disappearances of Cl?O from counter anions (i.e. 
perchlorate anion) in the IR spectra, which should appear around 1080?1130

3.2 Ring-Opening of Oxiranes with Alcohols 
Methyl, ethyl and dimethyl oxiranes were found to undergo smooth ring-
opening with alcohols, affording primary and secondary alkoxyalcohols when 
they were catalyzed by Taeniolite-supported Zr ?-diketonates (Table 2). The 
proposed mechanism of an SN1 mechanism is given in Scheme 3. The complex 
is predicted to initially provide a vacant space for oxirane-activation by a partial 
dissociation of coordinated diketone ligands (Scheme 3). A competitive SN2 
mechanism (due to a weak oxirane-activation) is likely the reason for the 
formation of secondary alkoxyalcohols. A unique activity behavior of 
Taeniolite-supported Zr ?-diketonates is given in Table 2. Entries 2?5 of the 
table describe an improvement trend in activity, while entries 6?9 describe a 
significant decline trend. Entries 10?13 describe a moderate decline trend. A 
factor to consider in rationalizing these phenomena is the clearance space 
Ring-opening of Oxiranes using Tris(É¿-Diketonato)Zr/Taeniolite 269 
 
relative to the molecular size of complexes, as observed from the PXRD 
patterns of the catalysts (Figure 1).

Scheme 3 Proposed mechanism of a ring-opening reaction of oxiranes with 
alcohols in SN1 fashion to afford primary alkoxyalcohols. Counter anions from 
Taeniolite layers not shown for simplicity. 
In entries 2?5, a relatively small size of methyl oxirane provides good 
accessibility for the substrate to diffuse into clay layers, even though some of 
the clay-supported zirconium complexes possess a relatively low clearance 
space. The rate-determining step in such a case is likely the substrate diffusion 
step.  In entries 6?9, a relatively large size of ethyl oxirane provides poor 
accessibility for the substrate to diffuse into clay layers, unless the clearance 
space of the catalyst is considerably high, such as that on 2a/TN, which in fact 
demonstrates the highest activity in this series. In entries 10?13, we found that a 
significant decline trend due to the bulkiness of the substrate was not observed. 
This can be explained by the fact that the intermediate compound resulted from 
dimethyl oxirane activation is a tertiary carbocation, which is more stable than a 
secondary carbocation resulted from monoalkyl oxiranes, such as methyl and 
ethyl oxiranes. Such an intermediate stabilization provides a longer lifetime of 
the intermediate to react with a nucleophile. Supportive evidence for this 
suggestion can be found in the higher selectivity of the primary isomers for the 
ring-opening of dialkyl oxiranes (Table 2, entries 10?13).

         a Conversion was calculated by GC. b Selectivity was confirmed by GC-MS. 
We have seen the effect of alcohol nucleophiles on the catalysis of oxirane ring-
opening using homogeneous Zr(IV) in one of our previous reports [7]. Here we 
have attempted to investigate the same effect when the reactions were catalyzed 
by immobilized Zr(IV) complexes. The reactions taken as models were the ring-
opening reactions of methyl oxirane with methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and i-
propanol, which were catalyzed by the 2a/TN catalyst. The catalytic data of 
these reactions are given in Table 3. The data show that the ring-opening 
reaction of methyl oxirane was independent of the type of alcohol when 2a/TN 
was employed in the reaction. This was likely due to a desolvation property 
inside the Taeniolite layers, which consequently enhanced the Lewis acidity of 
the complex, as it was poorly solvated [3,27,28]. Such a property is uniquely 
important because the same reaction with bulky nucleophiles demonstrates a 
considerably lower activity when catalyzed by the homogeneous counterparts 
(Table 3, entry 4).

4 Conclusion 
A series of organic/inorganic compounds prepared by immobilization of tris(É¿-
diketonato)zirconium(IV) complexes into Taeniolite has been synthesized. The 
compound serves as a good catalyst for the ring-opening reactions of methyl, 
ethyl, and dimethyl oxiranes with various alcohols to generate primary alkoxy 
alcohols in appreciable selectivity.  While bulky nucleophiles proceed in a very 
low activity of oxirane ring-opening in a homogeneous state, such nucleophiles 
show a significantly higher activity when the zirconium active species is 
immobilized into Taeniolite.
