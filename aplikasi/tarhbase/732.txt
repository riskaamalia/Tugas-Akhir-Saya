Abstract. Microstructure and chemical composition changes on the alloyed 
aluminum surface were investigated using SEM-EDX analysis. A Q-switched 
Nd:YAg laser was focused to induce breakdown and plasma formation. The high 
plasma temperature and the shock wave pressure were responsible for speeding 
up the laser surface alloying process. The rapid heat and cooling process 
introduced a non-equilibrium condition causing changes in the microstructure as 
well as the chemical composition of the alloyed aluminum surface. The remelted 
layer and molten pools were realized after the aluminum received a power 
density greater than 5 x 10

. The chemical composition change confirms 
that the convection process had taken place during the alloying process.

1 Introduction 
Laser is a powerful tool that can be used to improve surface properties such as 
hardness and wear resistance by modifying the composition and/or 
microstructure of the surface without affecting the properties of the bulk 
material. The interaction time between the material and laser beam leads to 
several processes. These processes are due to different combinations of 
absorption, heat conduction, melting, powder addition, and rapid solidification 
[1]. Among the various materials, aluminum is used in industry for various 
applications due to its low cost, light weight and excellent workability, but it 
lacks in wear resistance and hardness. Many studies have been carried out to 
improve the surface properties of aluminum by adding a powder of various 
materials, such as Fe, Ni, Mo, Cr, Ti, or Cu, Si [2-6]. Laser surface alloying is 
considered to be the most effective technique for surface modification [7-11]. 
However, systematic investigation of the microstructure and the change in 
54 Noriah Bidin, et al. 
chemical composition has received little attention. Hence, in the present paper 
we intend to demonstrate the effect of the laser parameters on the microstructure 
and chemical composition of the modified Al surface. 
2 Experiment 
A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm, 
operated in repetitive mode at 1 Hz, was used as the energy source. The laser 
pulse duration was 10 nanoseconds and the output energy remained constant at 
93 mJ per pulse. The laser was focused using a convex lens of 30 cm focal 
length to induce optical breakdown and plasma formation. In order to enlarge 
the laser spot area, the target was located at a defocused distance, about 20 mm 
away from the focal point. In this position the power density was estimated to 
be 1.31 x 10

 Wcm

 per pulse.  A quench rate can be reached in the range of     
2 - 4 Å~ 10
7
 K/s, corresponding to the lifetime of plasma radiation in air within 
the range of 300-500 ?s. The whole experimental setup used in this study has 
been described elsewhere [11].   
A pure aluminum plate was used as the substrate. Iron-copper (Fe-Cu) mixtures 
with weight/weight ratio 2:1 were used as the alloying elements. The aluminum 
surface was painted with glue prior to spraying it with the alloying elements. 
The coated surface was then treated by a series of pulses (1- 4 pulses equivalent 
to a power density of 1-6 Å~ 10
8
 Wcm
-2
) from the focused beam of the Q-
switched Nd:YAG laser.     
A glow discharge spectrometer (GDS) was employed to evaluate the 
distribution of the alloyed elements within the skin depth of the surface layer. 
The microstructure of the alloyed samples was characterized by using an optical 
scanning electron microscope (SEM). The chemical composition changes of the 
modified aluminum surface were analyzed using energy dispersive x-ray 
spectroscopy (EDXS). 
3 Results and Discussion  
It is important to note that the plasma temperature (~11,000 K) is much higher 
than the melting points each of the alloying elements deposited on the 
aluminum surface. Hence, after laser interaction with the powders that are 
coated on the aluminum surface, the absorbed energy decomposes the metal 
grains and dissolves the metals into the aluminum substrate, thus forming the 
surface alloy. The plasma dynamically expands in the free surface within 300 to 
500 É s depending on the delivering energy at the focal point. This implies that 
the higher the laser energy, the longer the lifetime of the plasma formation. 
However, in reality such microsecond lifetimes of plasma formation are still

considerably short. The advantage of such a short plasma lifetime is that it 
introduces a rapid cooling or quenching in the alloying process. Such high 
speed alloying processes can control the heat dissipation in the bulk of the 
aluminum base. Furthermore, laser induced plasma is associated with the 
generation of acoustic shock waves that propagate with the speed of sound in 
the medium [12]. This allows the acceleration of the heat transfer into the target 
via convection. Such mechanisms contribute to rapid melting and cooling of all 
target elements, including the matrix materials. This leads to the formation of an 
alloyed layer within the skin depth region.  
This phenomenon can be confirmed by analyzing the alloyed surface with a 
glow discharge spectroscopy, GDS machine. A typical GDS result of the tested 
samples is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1(a) indicates the element distribution of 
the aluminum substrate before coating and untreated by laser radiation. One 
hundred percent of the surface as well as the bulk contained Al elements apart 
from a few other elements, like N, Fe2, Cr and C. Figure 1(b) shows the 
distribution of Fe elements (50%) and copper (almost 30%) on the surface. The 
graph also indicates the penetration of Fe elements into the aluminum bulk. The 
Fe elements were defused into the bulk due to the heat transfer via convection 
of the melt pool of Al. The Fe elements were diffused within a skin depth of 25 
É m and the Cu elements almost 15 É m in the bulk of Al. The skin depth of the 
modified surface was also controlled by the quenching rate.

The rapid quenching rate contributed to non-equilibrium conditions in the 
aluminum base. This led to the formation of new alloy elements and hence 
56 Noriah Bidin, et al. 
changed the microstructure of the solidified surface layer as well as the 
chemical composition of the alloyed surface. The formation of the new alloyed 
elements was further validated via SEM examination and EDX analysis. The 
microstructure of the alloyed aluminum before laser treatment was examined 
with SEM, as shown in Figure 2(a). The Fe and Cu are clearly observable as 
individual particles on the Al matrix. The spectrum of the chemical composition 
of the coating material on the Al matrix is shown in Figure 2(b) and detailed 
weight percentages for each element analyzed with EDX spectroscopy are listed 
in Table 1. In a circle remarked, the dark grey indicates the Fe elements, 
whereas the white indicates Cu elements. Table 1 shows that the weight 
percentage of iron is remarkably high, but zero for copper. Chlorine exists due 
to the gum material used to adhere the coating material to the Al matrix.

Figure 3 depicts the microstructure of the alloyed surface after exposure by a 
series of pulses. Initially the sample was exposed to a single pulse (Figure 3(a)). 
Each pulse delivered a power density of 1.31 Å~10
8
 Jcm
-2
. This power was 
enough to melt and re-solidify the alloyed elements. As the power density 
increased, the remelted layer expanded, as depicted in Figure 3(b), (c) and (d). 
Significant heavy remelting is shown in Figure 3(c). Almost all the alloyed

elements were blended together to form new intermetalics phases or new 
composites. Despite experiencing a metastable phase transition, in the Al matrix 
also molten pools were created around the heating zone, as marked by the white 
arrow in Figure 3(d).

pulses, (c) 3 pulses, (d) 4 pulses. 
The spectrum of the chemical composition resulting from the EDX analysis is 
shown in Figure 4, arranged according to the increasing number of pulses. Each 
of the constituents is the average from the scanning electron image. This 
analysis corresponds to the conventional process. This means that with a low 
power density, only a small area was melted and subsequently involved only 
small chemical composition changes. Apperantly, as more power was delivered 
to the surface, more heavy elements like Cu and Fe sank into the bulk. 
Consequently, only a small amount of chemical constituents could be traced. As 
a result, the Al elements rose up, but the Fe elements sank down and even 
ellimanted the copper elements, because they sank deeper into the Al bulk. The 
detailed chemical composition changes with respect to the various exposures are 
tabulated in Table 2.

4 Conclusion 
The microstructure of aluminum alloyed with Fe-Cu has been investigated 
using SEM-EDX analysis. The aluminum was alloyed using the laser induced 
plasma technique. The plasma temperature was energetic enough to vaporize 
the skin depth layer resulting in melting and re-solidifying of the aluminum 
surface after the laser pulse had ceased. The SEM results show that the 
microstructure drastically changed with the energy density. Most of the exposed 
elements were melted and formed new composites, while molten pools were 
created close to the interaction zone after receiving a power density greater than 
5Å~10
8
 Wcm
-2
. Meanwhile, the EDX analysis shows that the chemical 
composition of the modified surface had changed, which confirms that a 
convection process took place during the alloying process.
