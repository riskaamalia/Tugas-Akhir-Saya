Abstract. The behavior of a dynamical system, in WillemsÅfs point of view, is 
the set of all trajectories of the system. Fuhrmann defines a behavior as a linear, 
shift invariant, and complete subspace of 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ?? , the vector space 
consisting of power series in 
1
z
?
 with coefficients in signal space =
m? ? . In 
this paper we show that the behavior of a finite dimensional, time invariant 
discrete linear system in WillemsÅfs setting is also a behavior according to 
FuhrmannÅfs. 
Keywords: behavior; complete; linear system; shift invariant; trajectories. 
1 Introduction 
Behavioral theory is a mathematical idea to study dynamical systems through 
the set of trajectories of the systems. The basic concept of the behavioral 
framework deals with a mathematical model of a system for what a model ought 
to be [1], highlighting some physical properties and practical questions of the 
system. Willems [1,2] defines a dynamical system as a triple, = ( , , )? ? ? B , 
where ?? ?  is the time axis, ?  is called the signal space, 
??  is the set of 
all transformations from ?  to ? , and ? ??B  is called behavior. The 
elements of B  are called the trajectories of the system. This definition is very 
general and can be loosely described.  
In general, the behavior of a linear system, in WillemsÅfs point of view [2] 
represents the set of all the trajectories of the system. Meanwhile, Fuhrmann [3] 
adopts WillemsÅfs [2] concept of a behavior for a discrete linear system by 
restricting ?  to the set of natural numbers, denoted by ?? , and ?  to 
m? , the 
m  dimensional vector space over a field ? . However, Fuhrmann does not 
define the behavior of a time invariant discrete linear system as the set of all the 
system trajectories. Fuhrmann defines a behavior as a linear, shift invariant, and 
complete subspace of the set 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ?? . The set 1 1[[ ]]mz z? ??  is a vector 
40 Sisilia Sylviani, et al. 
space consisting of power series in 
1
z
?
 with coefficients in signal space 
=
m? ? . These fenomena lead us to some questions: are both behaviors, 
according Willems [2] and Fuhrmann [3], equivalent? What is the relationship 
between these two concepts of behavior? This paper addresses part of these 
questions. Particularly, we show that for the case of a finite dimensional, time 
invariant, linear discrete system, behavior according to Willems is also behavior 
according to Fuhrmann. 
2 Preliminaries 
From now on, let ?  be an arbitrary field and m?  be the space of all m -tuples 
with components in ? . Notation 1(( ))z??  stands for the set of all formal series 
of the form 
=
i
ii n
f
f z
??
?  where if ??  and fn ?? , that is, it can be written as

=
(( )) = | , .

If 
=
( ) =
i
ii n
f
f z f z
??
?  and =( ) =
i
ii n
g
g z g z
??
? are both elements in 
1
(( ))z
?? , then 
the operations of addition and multiplication are defined by  
 
? ?= ,
( )( ) = ( ) ,
i
i i
i maks n n
f g
f g z f g z

and  
 
=
( )( ) = ,

k n n
f g
fg z h z
??
?
?
 
where 
=
=
k i k ii
h f g
??
???? . Note that kh  is well-defined, since it contains only a 
finite number of non-zero terms. The set 
1
(( ))z
??  forms a field and is called the 
field of truncated Laurent series [4]. 
The set of all polynomials of the form 
=0
n if
ii
f z?  where if ??  and fn  is a non-
negative integer, is denoted by [ ]z? . It can also be witten as

The set [ ]z?  can be expressed as a subset of 1(( ))z??  as follows:  
 
0
=
[ ] = | , .
i
i i f
i nf
z f z f n
?
? ? ?

The set [ ]z? , coupled with the standard component-wise addition and 
multiplication, forms an Euclidean domain [4]. 
The set of all formal series having indeterminate 
1
z
?
 and coefficients in the field 
? , is denoted by 1[[ ]]z?? . This set can be expressed as follows:  
 
1
=0
[[ ]] = | , = 0, 1, 2, .
i
i i
i
z f z f i
??
?
? ? ?
? ?
? ?
? ?
? ?? ?
 
Similar to the above polynomial ring, the set 
1
[[ ]]z
?? , coupled with standard 
addition and multiplication, forms an Euclidean Domain.  
The field of truncated Laurent series can be decomposed by the polynomial 
domain part and formal series domain part as follows [4]: 
 
1 1 1
(( )) = [ ] [[ ]]z z z z
? ? ?
?? ? ?
 
where  
 
1 1
= 1
[[ ]] = | , = 1, 2, .

? ?? ?
 
It is clear that the above definitions and notations, which are defined in terms of 
elements in the field ? , can be directly generalized in terms of elements in the 
vector space 
m?  and obtain the corresponding sets 1(( ))m z?? , [ ]m z? , and 
1
[[ ]]
m
z
?? . All of these sets can be formed as vector spaces over the field ?  and 
satisfy the following decomposition equation  
 
1 1 1
(( )) = [ ] [[ ]].
m m m
z z z z

Further, the set [ ]
m
z?  can also be identified by [ ]mz? , the set of m -tuples of 
elements in [ ]z?

Hence, the set [ ]
m

identifications also work for 
1

m

??  and 1(( ))m z?? .  
The set [ ]

[ ] = {( ( )) | [ ],1 ,1 }.

Similar to the vector case, elements in [ ]

the set [ ]

The set [ ]

We close this section by introducing the term shift invariant subspace which 
will be one property of a behavior. First, following the decomposition (1), we 
have the projection operator on the space of formal series 
1 1

the polynomial space [ ]

 Behavior for Time Invariant Finite Dimensional Discrete LS 43 
 
Definition 1. Let ?  be the shift operator defined in (2), and B  be a subspace 
of 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ?? . The subspace B  is called shift invariant if ( )? ?B B . 
Note that having defined the two notions above, we can introduce an action 
from the domain [ ]z?  to the space 1 1[[ ]]mz z? ??  which makes it become [ ]z? -
module. Particularly, the space 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ??  is an [ ]z? -module with operation 
of multiplication defined as follows: 
 =z h zh?
?

for all [ ]z z??  and 1 1[[ ]]mh z z? ?? ? . 
3 Behavior 
This section contains the main issue of this paper, that is the relevancy between 
the two ways of defining a behavior. The first subsection discusses the behavior 
by WillemsÅfs and FuhrmannÅfs point of view. The definition of the dynamic 
system will be discussed at the beginning of this section.  
3.1 WillemsÅfs Version of a Behavior 
This paper concentrates on finite dimensional, time invariant, discrete linear 
systems. Willems [2] defines a dynamic system as a triple, = ( , , )? ? ? B , 
where ?? ?  as time axis, ?  is called signal space, ??  is the set of all 
transformations from ?  to ? , and ? ??B  is called the behavior. The 
behavior of a linear system with discrete time is defined by Willems [2] as the 
set of all trajectories of the dynamical system. 
Consider a finite dimensional, time invariant, discrete linear system that 
satisfies the following difference equation:  
 1
= ,
k k k
x Ax Bu
?
?  (3) 
 where 
n
k
x ?? , m
k
u ?? , = 0,1,k ?, for some A , an n n?  matrix and B , an 
n m?  matrix with entries in the field ? . Let 
0
n
x ??  and a sequence of inputs 
0 1
, ,u u ?  be given, we obtain the corresponding state sequence 
1 2
, ,x x ?  which 
satisfies Eq. (3). Let represent the state sequence in the form of a formal series

Before discussing the definition of a behavior in FuhrmannÅfs point of view, we 
will first discuss the definition of a complete subspace of 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ?? .  
For each n
?
?? , let 
n
P  be the projection on 
1 1

We say that a subset 
1 1

m

? ?
? ?B  is complete if the following statement is 
satisfied: 
if for any 
1 1

? ? ? ?
?? ? , ( ) ( )N NP w P? B  for all N , then w?B . 
3.2 FuhrmannÅfs Version of a Behavior 
In the previous subsection we already discussed WillemsÅfs [2] definition of a 
dynamical system as triple, = ( , , )? ? ? B , where ?? ?  is the times axis, 
?  is called a signal space, ??  is the set of all transformations from ? to? , 
and ?
??B  is called the behavior. Fuhrmann adopted this concept for discrete 
linear systems by restricting the time set ?  with the set of all natural numbers, 
denoted by 
?
? , and restricting ?  with m? , the colomn vector space over the 
field ? . However, Fuhrmann defines a behavior as a linear, shift invariant, and 
complete subspace of 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ?? [3]. 
Even though Willems and Fuhrmann have a different point of view in defining a 
behavior, there is a linkage between both definitions of a behavior. That linkage 
is described in Theorem 3. 
 
 Behavior for Time Invariant Finite Dimensional Discrete LS 45 
 
Theorem 3. Let B be the behavior according to Willems for time invariant, 
discrete linear system satisfying difference Eq. (3), that is,  
 
0
=1
= | satisfy (3), for some and , = 0,1, 2, .
i n m

? ?B ? ?  
Then the set B  is a shift invariant and complete subspace of 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ?? . In 
other words,B  is a behavior in FuhrmannÅfs [3] point of view. 
 
Proof. Let

be a behavior for time invariant, discrete linear system. First of all, we will 
show that B  is a subspace of 
1 1

m
z z
? ?? . That is, it should be pointed out that 
B  is a nonempty subset of 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ??  that is closed under operation of 
addition and scalar multiplication.  
1. We will show that B  is non-empty, and that is so because

3. We will show that B  is closed under addition. Let

some

Hence,

? ? ? ?
? ? ? ?  for some 
0 0
n
x y? ?? , and 
m
i i
u v? ?? . Consequently, 1 1( ) ( )x z y z? ?? ?B . Thus, it is proved that B  
is closed under addition.  
4. We shall show that B  is closed under scalar multiplication. Let ? ??  and 
1
( )x z
?
?B , where 1 1
=1
( ) =
ii
x z x z
?? ?? , ix  satisfy (3), for some 0
n
x ?? , and 
m
i
u ?? , where = 0,1,2,i ? . We have  
 
1 1 1
=1 =1
. ( ) = ( ) = ( ) .
i i
i i
x z x z x z? ? ?
? ?
? ? ?? ?  
By assumption, 
i
x  satisfy (3), that is 
1 1
=
i i i
x Ax Bu
? ?
? . Consequently  
 
1 1
= ( ) ( )
i i i
x A x B u? ? ?
? ?
?  
for some 
0
n
x? ?? , and m
i
u? ?? . So, 1( )x z? ? ?B .  
Therefore, since B  is a subset of 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ??  that is non-empty and closed 
under addition and scalar multiplication, we can conclude that B  is a subspace. 
 
Now, we shall show that B  is shift invariant. In other words, we have to show 
that ( )? ?B B , where ?  is the shift operator defined according to (2). Let 
( )g ?? B . There exists

? ?

where

x ?? , and m
i

1 1

Thus

Consequently, f ?B . Thus B  is complete. 
As a conclusion, we have proved that B  is a shift invariant and complete 
subspace of

of view.

4 Conclusion 
Willems [1,2] defined a dynamical system as triple, = ( , , )? ? ? B , where 
?? ?  is the time axis, ?  is signal space, and ? ??B  is the behavior and 
??  is the set of all transformations from ?  to ? . The behavior of a linear 
system, based on WillemsÅfs [2] point of view, is defined as the set of all 
trajectories of the dynamical system. Meanwhile, Fuhrmann [3] defined the 
behavior of a discrete time, linear systems as a shift invariant and complete 
subspace of the corresponding formal series module 
1 1
[[ ]]
m
z z
? ?? . In this article 
we have shown that the behavior of a system in WillemsÅfs point of view [2], for 
the case of a finite dimensional, time invariant, discrete linear system, is also 
behavior according to Fuhrmann [3]. The converse of this result is expected to 
be true and is still an open question under investigation.
