Abstract. The storage effects on the oxidation characteristics of fatty acid 
methyl ester of canola oil (CME) were investigated in this study.CME stabilised 
with two antioxidants, i.e.2,6-di-tert-bytyl-p-cresol (BHT) and 6,6-di-tert-butyl-
2, 2Åf-methylendi-p-cresol (BPH), was stored at 20, 40 and 60ÅãC.The oxidation 
stability data were measured by the Rancimat test method and it was found that 
both BHT and BPH addition increased the oxidation resistance of the CME. The 
results showed that when BPH or BHT was added at a concentration of 100 ppm, 
the oxidation induction period of the neat CME samples increased from 5.53 h to 
6.93 hand 6.14h, respectively. Comparing both antioxidants, BPH proved to be 
more effective in increasing the oxidation resistance when both antioxidants 
were added at the same concentration. Furthermore, the oxidation induction time 
decreased linearly with the storage time. It was shown that the oxidation 
occurred rapidly in the first 8 weeks of storage. Later, a kinetic study was 
undertaken and first-order kinetics were applied to explain the oxidation 
characteristics of the CME added with antioxidants. This kinetic study focused 
on exploiting the activation energy values obtained from the Arrhenius 
equations. Also, the oxidation effects on other quality parameters, including acid 
value, peroxide value, kinematic viscosity, and water content, were examined. 
Keywords: antioxidants concentration; canola fatty acid methyl ester; oxidation 
stability; temperature effects; time of storage. 
1 Introduction 
Recently, biodiesel of methyl ester, one of several alternative diesel fuels, is 
made from vegetable oil and animal fat through methanol transesterification. 
Interest has been aroused in their use as they are biodegradable and release a 
low level of toxic gas emissions into the environment. The mechanism of 
transesterification reaction consists of three reversible reactions, in which 
triglyceride is converted into diglyceride, monoglycerides and glycerol 
304 Tirto Prakoso, et al. 
sequentially [1]. The composition of the fatty acid structure is determined by the 
type of feedstock [2], while the optimum reaction conditions depend on the state 
of the supplied oil, which has been investigated for the effective production of 
biodiesel fuel. Each type of biodiesel feedstock contains its own fatty acid 
composition, and this chemical structure influences the properties of methyl 
ester as a biodiesel fuel, such as oxidation stability, cetane number, iodine 
value, cold filter plugging point, etc. [2]. The presence of free fatty acids and 
water always brings negative effects to the biodiesel yield owing to soap 
formation and the consumption of alkaline catalysts. As a result, the addition of 
an alkaline catalyst decreases reaction effectiveness and a gives lower yield [3, 
4]. The conditions for biodiesel production are considered optimal when they 
have a high yield of alkyl ester, are easy to operate and cost-effective. 
The combustion properties of biodiesel fuel are similar to those of petroleum 
diesel fuel. One important quality of good biodiesel fuel is its resistance to 
oxidation during storage, especially under high-temperature conditions and on 
air exposure. The relative rates of oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, like 
linolenate and linoleate methyl esters, are higher than those of monounsaturated 
fatty acids, like oleate methyl esters [5].The presence of double bonds in fatty 
acid molecules can result in a high level of reactivity with oxygen when the fuel 
is exposed to air during storage. Besides the presence of air, other factors that 
affect the oxidation process of biodiesel include presence of light, heat, traces of 
metal, peroxide and the surface area between biodiesel and air [6]. Thus storage 
and handling are also important factors that can affect the oxidation of 
biodiesel. The oxidation finally results in the formation of carboxylic acids with 
high molecular weight as well as low molecular weight [7]. These substances 
will cause an increase in the viscosity of the biodiesel fuel, which can result in 
fuel line and pump clogging. The peroxides produced during oxidation will also 
cause an increase in cetane number,which can have a negative effect on the 
plastic and elastomer partsof an engine, such as swelling and ageing problems. 
Moreover, the acid forms will cause corrosion on metal components [8]. 
One approach to increase the oxidation resistance of biodiesel is to treat it with 
an oxidation inhibitor or antioxidant. Commonly used antioxidants are 
monohydroxy or polyhydroxy phenol compounds with various ring 
substitutions. These antioxidant compounds have low activation energy to 
donate hydrogen in order to interrupt the propagation of the free radical chain. 
In other words, the compounds can delay the start and/or slow down the 
chemical reaction rate of oxidation. The resulting antioxidant free radicals do 
not initiate other free radicals due to the stabilisation by delocalisation of the 
radical electron and it can also react with lipid free radicals to form stable 
complex compounds [9].  
Storage Oxidation Stability of Canola FAME with Antioxidant  305 
The purpose of this work is to investigate the oxidation characteristics of canola 
fatty acid methyl ester (CME). Canola is one of two cultivars of rapeseed that 
produce edible oil. CME was produced on a laboratory scale to be used for the 
investigation. The reason Canola has been chosen is that it is very popular and 
easy to obtain as cooking oil in Japan and European countries. As this type of 
biofuel consists of a high concentration of unsaturated fatty acid, the oxidation 
stability is predicted to be considerably lower compared to palm oil, so that it is 
important to enhance its stability by adding antioxidants. Canola oilÅfs main 
composition is 60% oleic acid, 20% linoleic acid, and 8% linolenic acid. The 
remaining percentage consists of stearic and palmitic acids.  
Two phenolic types of antioxidants were used in this work, i.e.2,6-di-tert-butyl-
4-methylphenol (BHT) and 2,2Åf-methylenebis(6-t-butyl-4-methylphenol) 
(BPH). Different oxidation states were achieved and as a result the oxidation 
stability could be controlled. The oxidation stability of the CME stabilised with 
two types of antioxidants at varying concentrations was examined primarily. 
Then changes in the oxidation stability index (OSI), expressed by the induction 
period of the Rancimat test (IP), were monitored during storage. Karavalakis, et 
al. have investigated the performance of other phenolic antioxidants, such as 
BHA, on biodiesel blends made from 50% rapeseed oil, 20% sunflower oil and 
30% used frying oils [10]. They compared the performance of two phenolic 
antioxidants, which both only had one phenolic group attached to each 
molecule. However, BHT has one phenolic group phenolic groups attached to 
each molecule, while BPH has two. Comparing the two antioxidants, BPH is 
expected to have an antioxidant performance superior to that of BHT or BHA. 
First-order kinetics were then employed to describe the oxidation process 
according to the observation of a linear relationship between the logarithmic 
values of the OSI and particular ranges of storage time in this investigation.  
The handling provided an explanation for changes in the induction period of the 
oxidation process. Jiayu Xin, et al. have investigated kinetically the oxidation 
stability of safflower methyl ester stabilised with propyl gallate at various 
concentrations and at elevated temperatures [11]. They analysed the oxidation 
stability data by following the effect of the decrease in antioxidant 
concentration on the induction period of the Rancimat test to elucidate the 
oxidation characteristics. Their analysis also employed first-order reaction rate 
kinetics to illustrate the oxidation of biodiesel fuel. Even though the handling 
process in our study was different from their case, in which this was based on 
the chemical reactions because of the decreasing density of the antioxidants, 
first-order kinetics could also be applied to the storage tests. 
306 Tirto Prakoso, et al. 
By comparing the assumed rate constant obtained from storage temperatures of 
20, 40 and 60ÅãC, the activation energy was calculated from the Arrhenius plots 
of each CME sample. Thus the oxidation characteristics could be compared to 
each other. These could be further related to other quality parameters, such as 
the acid value and peroxide value, which also varied over the storage period of 
the biodiesel fuel. 
2 Experiment 
2.1 Chemical and Materials 
Methanol, potassium hydroxide (KOH), sulfuric acid and glycerol of reagent 
grade were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, 
Japan. Antioxidants BHT and BPH were reagent grade and purchased from 
Wako also. Canola oil (Nisshin Oilio, Ltd., Japan), which had been purchased in 
the market, was used as the source for the CME. 
2.2 Preparation of CME 
Transesterification of food grade canola oil was carried out. Firstly, KOH 
(1.67%w/w of oil) was dissolved in methanol (22.50%w/w of oil) and the 
mixture was added to vegetable oil. The excess KOH and excess methanol 
(14% w/w oil) were added to the mixture in order to meet the minimum ester 
content of 96.5% at the end of the reaction. The mixture was then preheated to 
60ÅãC under stirring for 1 hour. The separated fatty acid methyl ester layer was 
washed with water to remove residual acid and methanol, and subsequently the 
product was dried to remove moisture. The mono-, di- and triglyceride contents 
of the CME were then analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography 
in order to evaluate thecompletion of the reaction. 
2.3 Storage of CME and Oxidation Stability Test 
The neat CMEs and those added with BHT and BPH at a concentration of up to 
600 ppm were put in 300 mL bottles and stored at 20, 40 and 60ÅãC. The 
oxidation stability tests were carried out every 2 weeks. The peroxide values 
and acid values were measured every 4 weeks, while kinematic viscosity and 
water content were measured every 8 weeks. The oxidation stability was 
evaluated mainly by the induction period tested by a Rancimat apparatus (Type 
743, Metrohm Schweiz AG, Switzerland) according to the standard test method 
specified in BS EN 14112.  
2.4 Chemical Analysis 
The peroxide value was determined by a potentiometric meter (Titrando 809, 
Metrohm) and the acid value was determined using a potentiometric automatic 
titrator (GT-100, Mitsubishi Chemical Analitica Co., Japan) in conjunction with 
Storage Oxidation Stability of Canola FAME with Antioxidant  307 
an auto sample changer (GT-07). The kinematic viscosity of the FAMEs was 
measured at 40ÅãCby a viscosity meter in a water bath (VB-X6, Yoshida Kagaku 
Kikai Co., Japan), while the water content was measured using an 831 Karl-
Fischer coulometer (Metrohm). The standards referred to in this research are 
listed in Table 1.

3 Results and Discussion 
3.1 Chemical Characterisation of CME 
The chemical properties of the CME are summarised in Table 2. The acid value 
and kinematic viscosity of the CME were within the range of the standard levels 
specified in the EN and ASTM standards. The oxidation stability of the CME 
was 5.53h, which corresponds to that of methyl ester prepared from wasted 
cooking oil. However, the EN standard requires the oxidation stability to reach a 
minimum of 6 h, therefore a modification of the CME is essential. 
 
The period of oxidation stability required to meet the EN and ASTM standards 
is 6h and 3h, respectively. However, the standard of the ERIA (Economic 
Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia) group, which considers the use of 
biodiesel fuel mainly in Southeast Asian countries, requires a stability time of 
longer than 10h [12]. In order to meet this ERIA requirement, further 
stabilisation of the CME was necessary. For this purpose antioxidants BHT and 
BPH were added. The influence of several parameters, i.e. antioxidant addition, 
storage temperature and storage period, on the characteristics of the oxidation 
resistance were then examined.Using these experimental results, the kinetic 
analyses were attempted and the characterisation of the modified CME was 
made. 
 
Figure 1shows the effects of the addition of antioxidants BHT and BPH on the 
induction period of canola methyl ester (CME). Both antioxidants were added at 
a concentration of up to 600 ppm, and the changes in the induction period of the 
Rancimat test were compared. The influence of these anti oxidants on the 
increase of the induction period were proved. Furthermore it should be noted 
that the stability effect was, in general, greater for BPH, in which two atoms of 
hydrogen in the phenolic hydroxyl form can contribute to the stabilisation. The 
308 Tirto Prakoso, et al. 
induction period of CME exceeded 6h, which is the EN 14214 standard value 
when either BHT or BPH are added at 100 ppm. In addition, the induction 
period increased with the increase of the added antioxidant concentrations.

3.2 Storage and Temperature Effects 
The neat CMEs and those stabilised with antioxidants were stored at 20, 40 and 
60ÅãC respectively, and the effects of temperature on oxidation stability were 
examined by the Rancimat test method. The FAMEs were contacted to air 
Storage Oxidation Stability of Canola FAME with Antioxidant  309 
during storage, but the samples were kept out of the light by being stored in a 
dark place. The temperature levels were selected by considering the general 
practice of storing oils, and accelerated oxidation effects were also expected to 
happen under the selected conditions.  
 
The oxidation stability is of course dependent primarily on the type of biodiesel 
fuel. It is also affected by other storage parameters, i.e. antioxidant type, 
antioxidant concentration and storage temperature. The decay of the oxidation 
stability is naturally suppressed when the antioxidant concentration becomes 
higher or the storage temperature is lower. 
 
Figures 2shows typical examples of the dependence of oxidation stability on 
storage time for the CMEs stabilised with BHT (a) or BPH (b), measured at 
40ÅãC (c). The induction period decreased more at the first stage, e.g. up to eight 
weeks, and then the decreasing degree became smaller. A similar behavior was 
observed in the storage tests for 20and 60ÅãC.Furthermore, figure 2 shows that 
the temperature influence was more significant, i.e. the decreasing degree 
became more prominent at 60ÅãC. It was evident from the results that the 
addition of the antioxidants was effective to increase the induction period and 
therefore the oxidation stability was improved. However, the decreasing 
behavior indicated clearly that the deterioration degree was faster at the initial 
stage of storage, and then the rate decreased gradually. Using these phenomena, 
kinetic analyses were applied to the change of the induction period of oxidation.

3.3 Kinetic Analyses of CME Oxidation 
Taking the decrease of the induction period of oxidation into consideration, 
kinetic analyses were attempted to examine storage behavior, and its effect on 
oxidation was investigated from a quantitative viewpoint. The results as shown 
in Figure 2 were used and kinetic studies were employed to examine the effects 
of antioxidant addition or temperature during storage. 
 
The logarithmic value of the induction time was obtained and its correlation 
with the storage time was examined. The result is shown in Figure 3 for the test 
conducted at 40ÅãC and a linear relation between these two parameters is 
observed. Similar relationships were also observed at 20 and 60ÅãC. This figure 
shows that the characteristics of the oxidation stability depended on the CME 
species, i.e. the slope was steeper for the neat CMEs and the CMEs stabilised 
with a smaller addition of antioxidants, indicating that the oxidation stability 
decreased faster.  
 
Taking the decaying linear characteristics into consideration, first-order-like 
reaction kinetics were employed to elucidate the oxidation stability 
characteristics of these CME samples, as depicted in Figure 3.

Here, ÅgAÅh is a constant given by the induction period at the initial stage of 
storage, and therefore, A=ln(Tos)o. Eq.(2) is then described in Eq. (3). The rate 
constant k can be obtained from the induction periods for the initial stage, (Tos)o 
and at the storage time of t, (Tos). Using k, the oxidative degradation levels can 
be compared to each other. 
  (3) 
The data of k are summarised in Figure 4 for the CME stabilised with BHT (a) 
and BPH (b), respectively. The oxidation characteristics of the CME appear 
clearly in this figure, i.e. the value of k becomes higher with an increase of the 
storage temperature, but is lower if BHT or BPH is added. This indicates that 
the oxidation of the CME increased with the temperature increase, and was 
decreased effectively by the addition of the antioxidants.The addition of 
600ppm BHT antioxidant can decrease the oxidation rate up to 47% at a 
temperature of 40 and 60ÅãC, while at a temperature of 20 ÅãC the decrease of the 
oxidation rate can reach only 30% more than 0 ppm of BHT addition. The 
addition of 600 ppm BPH antioxidant can decrease the oxidation rate up to 40% 
more than the addition of 0 ppm at a temperature of 40and 60ÅãC, while at a 
temperature of 20ÅãC the decrease of the oxidation rate can reach only 12.5% 
more than the addition of 0 ppm of BHT. It was shown that BPH performs 
better than BHT as its suppression of the oxidation rate was 1.23 times that of 
BHT.

Figure 5 Activation energy (Ea) of neat CME and of CME added with BHT or 
BPH at 300 and 600ppm. 
Ea indicates the quantity of energy necessary for a chemical reaction, and 
therefore the effectiveness of an antioxidant can be examined by comparing its 
activation energies, i.e. reactions with a high barrier need a higher activation 
energy, while reactions with a low activation energy are low in oxidation 
resistance. With the addition of antioxidants, Ea increased and the oxidation 
stability of the CME was improved equally. We found that BPH addition at a 
concentration of 600ppm increased the size of Ea two times more than that of 
neat CME, and as a result oxidation was suppressed equally. When the 
effectiveness of BHT and BPH addition were compared, BPH proved to be 
more effective in increasing the oxidation stability. 
3.4 Generation of Organic Carboxylic Acids during Storage 
The oxidation proceeded during the storage of the CME and generated oxidative 
products. Among these products carboxylic acids with a low molecular weight 
appeared, such as formic acid, acetic acid and propionic acid. The CME stored 
for six months at 20, 40 and 60ÅãC was extruded in deionised water and the

quantitative analyses of the carboxylic acids was undertaken by liquid 
chromatography (Shimazdu, Kyoto, Japan). The results are summarised in 
Figure 6. The generation of carboxylic acid was not practically observed after 
six months of storage at a temperature of 20ÅãC, but along with the increase in 
storage temperature, the carboxylic acid generation became remarkable and 
exceeded the standard values by far (10 ppm for acids total). Thus the 
temperature effects on the oxidation of neat CME were evident. However, the 
production of these carboxylic acids could be suppressed remarkably by the 
addition of antioxidants.

3.5 Oxidation stability vs. Quality Parameter 
Peroxide and carboxylic acid structures are formed on the biodiesel fuel 
molecules as a result of oxidation, i.e. a chemical reaction of activated oxygen 
takes place on C=C bonds to form a peroxide structure, and oxidation finally 
leads to carboxylic acids formation. It is interesting to know how the generation 
of these oxidation products relates to the oxidation stability evaluated by the 
Rancimat method. For this purpose, the peroxide value (POV) and acid value 
(AV) were measured during the period that the oxidation stability tests of the 
Rancimat method were repeated. The correlation between these quality 
parameters and the oxidation stability characteristics was then investigated. In 
addition, the kinematic viscosity and water content were measured, and 
subsequently their correlation with the OSI was examined to clarify the effect of 
oxidation on these parameters. 
 
314 Tirto Prakoso, et al. 
(a) Peroxide value 
Figure 7 (a,b) shows the changes in the peroxide value for the CME samples 
stabilised with BHT (a) and BPH (b) and stored at 40 and 60ÅãC. The peroxide 
value increased with the increase of the storage time, which was affected by the 
modification of the CME, i.e. the addition of the antioxidants depressed the 
formation of peroxide. The POV of the CME added with BPH was relatively 
small compared to the POV of that added with BHT, and thus BPH was found 
to be more effective in depressing the peroxide formation.

(b) Acid value 
The acid value was measured and its changes were observed during storage. 
Figure 9 shows the correlation between the acid value and the storage time at a 
temperature of 40ÅãC for neat CME and CME stabilised with BHT at a 
concentration of 300ppm and 600 ppm respectively. As depicted in Figure 9, 
acid values increased gradually with the increase of the storage time and this 
change was suppressed when the BHTs were added. Similar behavior was 
observed in the other samples and under different storage conditions. However, 
the increase was more prominent when samples were stored at higher 
temperatures.

Figure 10 Correlation between acid value(AV) and oxidation stability index 
(OSI) for neat CME and CME stabilised with BHT or BPH during storage at 
20ÅãC (a), 40ÅãC (b) and 60ÅãC (c). 
As described before, the generation of carboxylic acid is mainly caused by the 
oxidation of FAME molecules. Therefore, the correlation between the acid 
316 Tirto Prakoso, et al. 
value and the OSI is considered to summarise the results. Figure 10 shows the 
correlation between the acid value and the OSI for neat CME and CME 
stabilised with BHT and BPH stored at 20ÅãC (a), 40ÅãC (b) and 60ÅãC (c), 
respectively. It is evident that the acid value and the OSI have a significant 
correlation. As the oxidation degree increases, the OSI is smaller and the acid 
value is higher. The degree increases with the increase of the storage 
temperature. 
(c) Kinematic viscosity and water content 
The oxidation of ester begins with the build-up of peroxides and carboxylic 
acid, after which the viscosity starts to increase. During storage, the viscosity of 
the methyl esters increases by the formation of more polar, oxygen-containing 
molecules and also by the formation of oxidised polymeric compounds, 
possibly leading to the formation of gums and sediments that can potentially 
clog the fuel line. In Figure 11(a), the viscosity data of all samples stored under 
a storage temperature of 20, 40 and 60ÅãC are plotted. It is illustrated that 
theviscosity values slightly increase with the decrease in OSI values, even 
though they still meet all standard values. Similarly, the water content is higher 
at lower OSI values, as depicted in Figure 11(b). It can be seen that the water 
contents lightly increases with the decrease in OSI values. In addition, 
adsorption of water from the atmosphere during storage cannot be ignored.

4 Conclusions 
The oxidation stability of neat CMEs and CMEs added with antioxidants during 
storage were investigated using the Rancimat test method. It is suggested that a 
Storage Oxidation Stability of Canola FAME with Antioxidant  317 
minimum of 600 ppm of BHT antioxidants or 300 ppm of BPH antioxidants is 
required to meet the EN14214 biodiesel standards. Effects of antioxidant 
addition were later compared quantitatively by analysing the value of reaction 
rate constants obtained from their first-order reaction kinetics. The BPH 
antioxidant performed better than the BHT antioxidant in this experiment, since 
the BPH its suppression of the oxidation rate was 1.23 times that of BHT. 
 
In addition, this study observed some changes in other quality parameters 
during storage, such as an increase in both peroxide value (POV) and acid value 
(AV). The formation of carboxilic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid and 
propionic acid caused an increased the AV after the samples were stored for six 
months under different temperatures.
