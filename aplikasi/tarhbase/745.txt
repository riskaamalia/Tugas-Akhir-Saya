Abstract. The use of flare gas as injection gas in miscible gas flooding enhanced 
oil recovery (MGF-EOR) presents a potential synergy between oil production 
improvement and greenhouse gases emission mitigation. This work is a 
preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of miscible flare gas injection based on 
phase behavior computations of a model oil (43%n-C5H12 : 57%n-C16H34) and a 
model flare gas (91%CH4 : 9%C2H6). The computations employed the multiple 
mixing-cell model with Peng-Robinson and PC-SAFT equations of state, and 
compared the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) value in the cases of flare 
gas injection and CO2 injection. For CO2 injection, both equations of state 
produced MMP values close to the measured value of 10.55 MPa. Flare gas 
injection MMP values were predicted to be 3.6-4.5 times those of CO2 injection. 
This very high MMP implies high gas compression costs, and may compromise 
the integrity of the reservoir. Subsequent studies shall explore the gas-oil 
miscibility behavior of mixtures of flare gas with intermediate hydrocarbon 
gases and CO2, in order to identify a suitable approach for rendering flare gas 
feasible as an injection gas in MGF-EOR. 
Keywords: miscible gas flooding; MMP; PC-SAFT; multiple mixing cell; EOR. 
1 Introduction 
Gas flaring refers to the disposal of light to intermediate molecular weight 
streams in process plants by incineration, and the subsequent release of the 
combustion gases to the atmosphere. Gas flaring by the oil and gas production 
sector is a major contributor to the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in 
Indonesia. In 2002, GHG emission generated by gas flaring in Indonesia was 
equivalent to approximately 72% of the total emission of the Asia-Oceania 
region, or approximately 5.6% of the global GHG emission [1]. In 2004, the 
total volumetric flow rate of gas flaring in Indonesia reached 358.3 MMSCFD, 
which was generated by 506 oil and gas production fields. This emission rate is 
equivalent to 4.3% of Indonesia's total natural gas production rate [2].  
 Miscibility Computation in Flare Gas Flooding 271 
 
An alternative application that could conceivably be engaged to reduce gas 
flaring from the oil and gas sector involves using the gas as an injection gas in 
the miscible gas flooding enhanced oil recovery (MGF-EOR) process. The 
MGF-EOR process basically involves the injection of light gases into the oil 
reservoir near or at the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), which is defined 
as the threshold reservoir pressure at which a complete miscibility between gas 
and oil occurs throughout the vapor-liquid interfacial contact zone (also known 
as the multiple-contact miscibility phenomenon). The miscibility of the 
injection gas in the oil dramatically decreases the viscosity of the oil, with a 
concurrent increase of its fluidity. If proven to be techno-economically feasible, 
the use of flare gas as injection gas in the MGF-EOR represents a significant 
advancement in the synergy between greenhouse gases management and oil 
production improvement efforts.  
The MMP is obviously a key engineering parameter in the design of an MGF-
EOR process. Unfortunately, the prediction of the MMP of an oil reservoir is 
not always trivial due to the dependence of this thermodynamic property on the 
composition of the trapped oil and on the reservoir temperature. These are 
properties that are not always known with sufficient accuracy. Laboratory 
estimation of MMP is traditionally done by using the slim tube apparatus, in 
which the injection gas are brought into contact with the oil inside a long, coiled 
tube packed with sand or fine glass beads. The profile of eluted oil quantity 
versus pressure is used to estimate the MMP. While this method is generally 
regarded as accurate, it tends to be time-consuming and costly [3]. Another, 
increasingly popular method is using the rising bubble apparatus (RBA), which 
estimates the MMP based on the visual observation of injection gas bubbles 
rising through a stagnant column of oil at varying pressure levels [4]. While this 
method is claimed to be faster and less costly than using the slim tube 
apparatus, it has the major drawback of involving the operator's subjectivity in 
interpreting the geometry of the bubbles.  
Estimation of MMP using a computational approach has been proposed as an 
alternative to the conventional laboratory measurement methods that offers 
lower costs and a higher flexibility to changes in fluid composition. The various 
computational methods proposed in the literature can be divided into three 
major approaches, namely 1-dimensional analytical computation, 1-dimensional 
slim tube approximation, and single or multiple mixing-cell methods [5].  
The 1-dimensional analytical computation approach is based on the analytical 
solution of flow equations as described by Orr [6]. Utilizing this analytical 
approach, Orr, et al. [7] and Johns, et al. [8] have identified three key tie lines in 
systems containing more than 3 components, namely initial, injection and 
crossover tie lines. These authors further defined MMP as the pressure at which 
272 Tjokorde W. Samadhi, et al. 
any of these key tie lines becomes critical. For a system containing a number of 
components (nc) Johns and Orr [9] concluded that the number of key tie lines 
associated with the miscibility development is nc-1. These key tie lines consist 
of an injection tie line intersecting the injection gas composition, an initial tie 
line intersecting the crude oil composition, and nc-3 crossover tie lines 
connecting the injection and initial tie lines. In 1-dimensional slim tube 
approximation, oil recovery obtained by slim tube experiments is estimated by 
fine-grid compositional computation. In addition to consuming considerable 
computing time, such a method is prone to numerical dispersion [10].  
In the mixing cell approach, the gas and oil are mixed in repeated contacts, 
either in a single or a series of perfectly mixed cells [11]. Equilibrium vapor-
liquid compositions resulting from these contacts are determined by flash 
calculations, and are used to determine the key tie lines. Jaubert, et al. [12] 
described the multiple-mixing cell (MMC) model as a series of equilibrium 
cells in which vapor-liquid phase equilibration occurs via flashing, as presented 
in Figure 1. The authors proposed that MMP is strictly a thermodynamic 
property that is not influenced by fluid-flow variables such as relative 
permeability, capillary pressure, and interfacial tension. Among the various 
MMP computation methods, the MMC model is particularly attractive due to its 
simplicity and computational robustness. By describing the gas-oil contact as a 
series of perfectly mixed cells, the key problem in MMP computation is reduced 
to the selection of the appropriate thermodynamic equation of state for 
computing the vapor-liquid equilibrium of the MGF-EOR system. 
 
Figure 1 Schematic description of the multiple mixing-cell (MMC) model.  
This study represents a preliminary evaluation of the technical feasibility of 
using flare gas as an injection gas in the MGF-EOR process. Essentially, this 
evaluation involves the comparison of the MMP values for flare gas injection 
with those for the conventional CO2 injection process.  
2 Methodology 
As a preliminary investigation, the oil and flare gas compositions are 
represented by model mixtures containing minimum numbers of components.

preferred. Based on these criteria, a binary system containing n-C5H12 and n-
C16H34 at a molar ratio of 43%:57% was selected as the model oil. Two gas 
injection cases for this binary oil are considered in this work, namely: (1) 
injection by pure CO2, which constitutes a ternary system, and (2) injection by a 
binary model flare gas consisting of CH4 and C2H6 at a molar ratio of 91%:9%, 
which constitutes a quaternary system. The CO2 miscible flooding of this model 
oil has been described by Mihcakan and Poettman [4]. The methane-ethane ratio 
in the model flare gas was obtained from the normalization of the average flare 
gas composition in Indonesia described by Crosetti and Fuller [2]. In 
accordance with the laboratory estimation of MMP described by Mihcakan and 
Poettman [4], the temperature for the MMP computations was set at 323.15 K 
for all runs. 
Two families of thermodynamic equations of state were considered in this 
study, namely cubic and analytical equations of state. The cubic equation of 
state is represented by the widely used Peng-Robinson model. The analytical 
equation of state is represented by two forms of the statistical associating fluid 
theory (SAFT) method. The latter method is derived from Wertheim's 
perturbation theory, in which the Helmholtz free energy of a real fluid is 
expressed as the sum of a reference fluid (or ideal fluid) contribution and a 
residual energy contribution [13]. The two forms of SAFT selected for this 
study are the SAFT-HR model developed by Huang and Radosz in 1990 [14], 
and the PC-SAFT model developed by Gross and Sadowski in 2001 [15]. 
SAFT-HR is regarded as the first successful engineering version of SAFT. The 
reference fluid in the SAFT-HR model is an ensemble of hard spheres. The 
residual free energy contribution is described as the sum of: (1) repulsive 
interactions between the hard spheres, (2) energy change due to the formation of 
molecules, described as chains of hard spheres, (3) non-specific repulsive forces 
described as dispersion, (4) specific associative forces between the molecules 
(or between the chains of hard spheres), representing such forces as polar 
molecules interactions, hydrogen bonding, etc. The PC-SAFT, or perturbed 
chain SAFT model, is one of the most widely used fundamental modifications 
of the original SAFT model. The PC-SAFT model employs an ensemble of hard 
chains in lieu of hard spheres as the reference fluid. While the mathematical 
procedures entailed in the PC-SAFT model are fundamentally equivalent to 
those in the SAFT-HR model, the structural parameters required to describe 
molecules and intermolecular interactions are obviously different, owing to the 
fundamentally different description of the reference fluid.  
The multiple mixing-cell model originally described by Metcalfe, et al. [11] and 
modified by Jaubert, et al. [12] was used as the core simulation method for 
MMP estimation. The schematic diagram of this model is presented in Figure 1. 
As outlined previously, the MMC computation method involves a series of gas 
274 Tjokorde W. Samadhi, et al. 
and oil mixtures, vapor-liquid equilibrium composition determination via P,T-
flash calculations, and partitioning and transfer of the equilibrated fluids to the 
next mixing cell. After each P,T-calculation in a particular cell is completed, the 
partitioning rules described by Jaubert, et al. [12] are applied: 
1. If the cell contains only vapor or liquid, then transfer the fluid in excess of 
the cell volume to the next cell. 
2. If the cell contains both vapor and liquid phases, the vapor phase takes 
priority over the fluid transfer: 
? transfer the vapor in excess of the cell volume to the next cell 
? if the entire vapor phase has been moved and the volume of the 
remaining liquid is still larger than the cell volume, then transfer the 
excess liquid phase to the next cell. 
The MMC computation in this study was undertaken using a Fortran-based 
package described in an earlier work [16]. Prior to the calculations, the user 
defines the fluid composition and relative quantities (with the gas to oil molar 
ratio or GOR), pressure and temperature of the system, and pure and binary 
interaction parameters of the system components.  
Binary interaction parameters kij for the Peng-Robinson equation of state were 
obtained from the literature [17]. The values for SAFT-HR and PC-SAFT were 
obtained by trial-and-error fitting of VLE composition data of each binary pair. 
Table 1 provides a list of the binary interaction parameters employed in this 
study. 
Table 1 Binary interaction parameters (kij) used in this study.

After the binary kij parameters had been defined for all binary pairs, two steps 
followed: 
1. binary VLE calculations to select the SAFT equation that produces the 
highest accuracy. 
2. MMC computation to estimate the MMP values for the cases of CO2 
injection and flare gas injection, using the Peng-Robinson and the SAFT 
equation of states selected in the previous step. 
 Miscibility Computation in Flare Gas Flooding 275 
 
To estimate the MMP value from the multiple mixing-cell calculation requires 
the replacement of Jaubert's original method of computing the oil recovery at 
gas injection of 1.2 times the pore volume by a simplified constant tie length 
zone identification as described by Ahmadi and Johns [18]. In this approach, 
key tie lines are identified as constant line zones in the tie line vs. cell number 
results. As the pressure is increased, key tie line lenghts are decreased, with the 
length of the critical tie line decreasing faster with pressure compared to the 
other key tie lines [18]. When the length of the critical tie line is sufficiently 
close to zero, the computation is terminated, and the tie line length versus 
pressure curve is extrapolated to zero length to obtain the MMP.

In general, Figures 2 through 7 indicate that all three equations of state provide 
a very good fit with the vapor-phase composition data for systems not 
containing CO2. This is especially true at low to intermediate pressures. Figures 
5 and 6 suggest that the Peng-Robinson model tends to be more accurate near 
the critical point. For the CO2-nC16H34 system, which seems to exhibit the 
largest dissimilarity in terms of polarity and molecular geometry of all pairs in 
Table 2, all three equations of state indicate poor agreement in the vicinity of 
the critical point. This behavior is not surprising, since these equations of state 
are essentially based on the mean-field theory, which involves the evaluation of 
exponentially-behaved quantities near the critical point, which makes 
convergence of the computation difficult [25]. The Peng-Robinson model

produces the best fit with the liquid-phase composition data at low to 
intermediate pressure levels.    
The absolute errors of the binary VLE calculation results compiled in Table 2 
suggest that the overall accuracy of the Peng-Robinson model is comparable to 
that of the SAFT-HR model for binary systems relevant to this study. Of the 
two SAFT models, PC-SAFT exhibits the highest accuracy. Therefore, the 
Peng-Robinson and PC-SAFT models were selected for the subsequent work of 
computing the MMP values of CO2 and flare gas injection systems. 
3.2 MMP Estimation 
In the MMC computation, the simulation package records vapor-liquid 
equilibrium compositions in each mixing cell if the overall fluid composition of 
the cell lies in the two-phase region of the system. The vapor-liquid equilibrium 
compositions are then used to calculate the tie line length of each mixing cell, 
resulting in reduced data set in the form of tie line length versus cell number 
curves.  
The predicted phase behavior of the ternary CO2-C5H12-C16H34 system 
representing the CO2 injection case is presented in Figure 8. This figure plots 
the two-phase boundary predicted by the Peng-Robinson and the PC-SAFT 
equations of state at 10.34 MPa and 323.15 K. Data points measured by 
Mihcakan and Poettman [4] are included in the ternary diagram.

Figure 8 indicates that both equations of state are generally not capable of 
accurately predicting the heavy (or liquid) phase composition. The Peng-
Robinson equation of state predicts a narrower phase envelope compared to PC-
SAFT. As will be evident from the MMP estimation, this difference manifests 
itself in a lower MMP predicted by the Peng-Robinson equation of state.  
 
Figure 9 Example of MMC computation raw data for CO2 injection of nC5H12-
nC16H34 (molar ratio 43%:57%) model oil at 323.15 K and 9.4 MPa, using PC-
SAFT equation of state. 
Figure 9 provides an example of tie line length vs. cell number data for the CO2 
injection case, as calculated using the PC-SAFT equation of state. Since this is a 
ternary system (nc = 3), two types of key tie lines are observed, i.e. injection and 
initial tie lines. These key tie lines are identified as constant-length zones in 
Figure 8. The shorter length of the initial tie line suggests that this particular tie 
line will become critical (i.e. its length approaches zero) at MMP. The role of 
the initial tie line as the critical one suggests that the CO2 miscibility occurs 
through the vaporizing gas drive mechanism (VGDM), in which the dry 
injection gas vaporizes the intermediate hydrocarbons from the oil [26]. 
When the binary model flare gas is used as the injection gas, the gas-oil system 
becomes a quaternary system. Thus, as indicated in Figure 10, three types of 
key tie lines are identified. This figure provides an example of the raw data 
obtained by MMC computation for the flare gas injection case. This particular 
example was obtained from the computation at 323.15 K and 36.0 MPa. The 
crossover tie line is the critical tie line in this case. The criticality of the 
crossover tie line indicates that the mechanism of oil displacement by the

injection gas is shifted from VGDM in the CO2 injection case to a combined 
vaporizing/condensing gas drive in the flare gas injection case [27].

C2H6) injection of nC5H12-nC16H34 (molar ratio 43%:57%) model oil at 323.15 K 
and 36.0 MPa, using PC-SAFT equation of state. 
As the system pressure is increased, the length of all key tie lines decreases. 
Figure 11 describes the impact of pressure on key tie line lengths for the CO2 
injection case. By extrapolating the tie line length of the initial tie line using a 
cubic polynomial curve, the MMP values predicted by using the Peng-Robinson 
and the PC-SAFT equations of state are 9.78 and 10.20 MPa, respectively. 
Compared to the 10.55 MPa MMP value measured by the slim tube method 
reported by Yang, et al. [28], PC-SAFT provides a better estimate than the 
Peng-Robinson model. While the accuracy of both equations of state is quite 
satisfactory in this case, they predict substantially different tie line lengths at 
pressures above 9.4 MPa, indicating that the two-phase envelopes generated by 
these equations are also substantially different at higher pressure-levels.  
The MMP estimation for the flare gas injection case is described in Figure 12. 
Compared to the CO2 injection case, the discrepancy between the results 
obtained using the Peng-Robinson model and those using PC-SAFT are much 
more substantial, even at pressures much lower than the critical point. 
Comparing the behavior of the Peng-Robinson and the PC-SAFT equations of 
state in the critical region, it is likely that the results using the Peng-Robinson 
model are more accurate. While the current study is preliminary in nature, and 
therefore does not place a heavy emphasis on the optimization of binary 
interaction parameters of the equations of state, this large discrepancy may 
signal that there is room for substantially better parameter optimization,

The MMP values predicted for the flare gas injection case using the Peng-
Robinson and the PC-SAFT equations of state are 35.7 and 46.0 MPa, 
respectively.  These values are approximately 3.6-4.5 times the values obtained 
using CO2 as the injection gas. This extremely large increase in MMP is due to 
the lower solubility of methane and ethane in crude oil compared to the 
solubility of CO2. This behavior has been observed in miscible gas flooding 
studies of light and heavy crude oils by DeRuiter, et al. [29], Teletzke, et al., 
[3], and Bon and Sarma [30]. All of these authors observe through both 
experimental and simulation studies that CO2 produces the lowest MMP of the 
light gases employed for miscible and immiscible gas flooding. These gases 
include CO2, N2, natural gas, associated gas from oilfields, flue gas, and H2S-
containing acid gases.  
The large pressure increment required for creating multiple-contact miscibility 
in flare gas injection poses several substantial challenges for the further 
development of the MGF-EOR process. In addition to increasing the investment 
costs and operating expenses, such high miscibility pressure requirements may 
compromise the integrity of the rock formation structure of the reservoir. These

drawbacks should be weighed against the potential benefit of GHG emission 
reduction offered by the miscible flare gas injection process. Explorative studies 
on the effect of mixing flare gas with other components shall be undertaken. 
These studies will include the enrichment of the flare gas with intermediate 
components (in the propane-pentane range), and the combination of CO2 and 
flare gas, in which the CO2 may be produced by partial combustion of the flare 
gas.  
 
Figure 12 Key tie line lengths as functions of pressure for flare gas (91% CH4-
9% C2H6) injection of nC5H12-nC16H34 (molar ratio 43%:57%) model oil at 
323.15 K ( ? = injection tie line using Peng-Robinson model, ? = crossover tie 
line using Peng-Robinson model, ? = initial tie line using Peng-Robinson 
model, ? = injection tie line using PC-SAFT model, ? = crossover tie line using 
PC-SAFT model, + = initial tie line using PC-SAFT model). 
4 Conclusions 
In the prediction of binary vapor-liquid equilibrium composition data containing 
CO2, nC5H12, and nC16H34, Peng-Robinson and PC-SAFT equations of state 
produce good accuracy at low to intermediate pressure levels. In the vicinity of 
the critical point, the Peng-Robinson model provides a higher overall accuracy. 
Computation of miscible CO2 flooding of the model nC5H12-nC16H34 oil at 
323.15 K using the multiple mixing-cells model produces MMP values that are 
close to the published laboratory measurement value of 10.55 MPa. The use of a 
91% CH4 - 9% C2H6 model flare gas as the injection gas increases the MMP by 
3.6-4.5 times compared to CO2 injection, raising concerns about high
