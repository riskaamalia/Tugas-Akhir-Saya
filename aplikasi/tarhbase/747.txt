Abstract. In the literature, several approaches of designing a DCT/IDCT-based 
image compression system have been proposed. In this paper, we present a new 
RTL design approach  with as main focus developing a DCT/IDCT-based image 
compression architecture using a self-created algorithm. This algorithm can 
efficiently minimize the amount of shifter-adders to substitute multipliers. We 
call this new algorithm the multiplication from Common Binary Expression 
(mCBE) Algorithm. Besides this algorithm, we propose alternative quantization 
numbers, which can be implemented simply as shifters in digital hardware. 
Mostly, these numbers can retain a good compressed-image quality compared to 
JPEG recommendations. These ideas lead to our design being small in circuit 
area, multiplierless, and low in complexity. The proposed 8-point 1D-DCT 
design has only six stages, while the 8-point 1D-IDCT design has only seven 
stages (one stage being defined as equal to the delay of one shifter or 2-input 
adder). By using the pipelining method, we can achieve a high-speed architecture 
with latency as  a trade-off consideration. The design has been synthesized and 
can reach a speed of up to 1.41ns critical path delay (709.22MHz).   
Keywords: DCT/IDCT architecture; low complexity; mCBE Algorithm; multiplierless; 
new RTL design approach. 
1 Introduction 
Many kinds of digital image and video processing techniques have been 
proposed in the literature. Most of them, require discrete cosine transform 
(DCT). In this paper, we will discuss DCT-based image compression, one of the 
most interesting topics in image processing. Actually, DCT is not an algorithm 
specifically developed for image compression. But, we can take advantage of 
DCT theory to support well-performing image compression [1]. 
In the past years, many DCT-based researches have been conducted. Loeffler, 
C., et al. [2] proposed a low complexity DCT using the Flow-Graph Algorithm. 
This design requires 11 multiplications and 29 additions. Jeong, et al. [3] 
132 Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, et al. 
proposed a low-power multiplierless DCT architecture using image data 
correlation (cordic). Ruiz, et al. [4] proposed a high-throughput parallel-pipeline 
2D-DCT/IDCT processor. Heyne, et al. [5] proposed a combination of the 
Loeffler DCT and cordic method, which requires 38 adders and 16 shifters for 
8-point 1D-DCT and consists of 3 cordic blocks with several adders. Each block 
consists of an iterative shift-add operation and the longest path takes three 
iterations. Therefore, its longest path has an 8-stage delay (we define one stage 
as the delay of one shifter or 2-input adder). Byoung-Il Kim, et al. [6] have 
proposed a low-power multiplierless DCT for image/video coders. 
Subramanian, et al. [7] have proposed a VLSI implementation of a fully 
pipelined multiplierless 2D-DCT/IDCT architecture for JPEGs. 
In this paper, we propose a new approach of designing a DCT/IDCT-based 
image compression architecture. The main focus of our research was to develop 
the architecture by using a self-created algorithm that can efficiently minimize 
the amount of shifter-adders to substitute constant multipliers. We named it:  
multiplication from Common Binary Expression (mCBE) Algorithm. We also 
propose alternative quantization numbers, which can be implemented simply as 
shifters. Mostly, these numbers can retain a good compressed image quality 
compared to JPEG recommendations. We had three objectives. Firstly, the 
design had to be able to operate well, producing a good compressed image 
quality represented by Peak-to-peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean 
Square Error (MSE) values. Secondly, the design had to have less than 8-stage 
delay of flow-graph architecture without iterations for 8-point 1D-DCT/IDCT. 
Thirdly, the design had to have a small circuit area, be multiplierless, and have 
low complexity, so that it can be implemented easily in digital hardware. 
This paper is organized in a number of sections. First, the introduction section 
briefly introduces: (1) the importance of DCT theory in image compression 
systems, (2) several past researches about DCT-based image compression 
systems, and (3) the main points of the proposed design. This section is 
followed by a brief explanation of DCT/IDCT theory and its usage in image 
compression systems. The next section is about the proposed design. Here, we 
explain our design approach and its implementation in detail. This section is 
followed by the synthesis and analysis regarding our proposal. We also compare 
the proposed design with other design methods. In the following section, we 
explain the simulation and FPGA implementation. Finally, this section is 
followed by conclusion and references, respectively.  
2 Fundamental Theory 
In designing a DCT/IDCT-based image compression system, we need to use 
DCT/IDCT formulations and quantification-dequantification processing [8].

2.3 Basic DCT/IDCT-Based Image Compression System 
The main idea behind this image compression system is to reduce the image 
data size without significantly reducing image quality to the human eye. This 
technique will remove the least significant (high-frequency) information data 
from the image. The most significant information data usually have a low 
frequency. For the human eye it is more difficult to see differences in high 
frequencies than in low frequencies. Therefore, by eliminating the higher 
frequencies we can significantly reduce the image size without abandoning 
image quality.  
 
The input and output data of the DCT/IDCT-based compression system can be 
provided by using the YCbCr format. Input image data in JPEG format are 
converted to YCbCr format, which has three macroblock components: Y 
(luminance), Cb (chrominance blue), and Cr (chrominance red). Each 
component is computed based on microblock segmentation (8x8pixels), as 
shown in Figure 1. The inverse process is applied to the output data of the 
system in order to get the actual image (JPEG format).Therefore, by combining 
Eqs. (1) and (2) with microblock characters, we can compute 64-point data in a 
2D-DCT/IDCT process from an 8-point input 1D-DCT only. 
  
Figure 2 shows the details of the process of the complete compression system. 
In the complete compression system, first the image data will be represented as 
spatial domain data. These data will be transformed to frequency domain data 
using 2D-DCT processing. Then, we organize the frequency domain data in 
term of importance. Thus, we can eliminate the high-frequency data using 
134 Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, et al. 
quantification. Next, we do 2D-IDCT processing, which is the inversion of 2D-
DCT processing, to get the compressed image data in the spatial domain.

(8x8-pixels).

system.  
 
2.4 Quantization and Dequantization 
The other important modules in this compression system are quantization and 
dequantization. The quantization module performs the quantification process on 
the microblock data. The dequantization module performs the dequantification 
process on the microblock data. The general equation for quantization is:

Dequantization is the inverse of quantization. From equation (3), we have 
DCT(u,v) and Q(u,v) as input for the quantification process. Parameters u and v 
represent row and column location. DCT(u,v) represents the image data location 
in a microblock (8x8pixels) and Q(u,v) represents the quantizer numbers in the 
quantization matrices (denominators of the quantification process). There is no 
fixed numbers of quantization matrices. It is the prerogative of the user to select 
the quantization matrices. However, the JPEG committee has recommended a 
number of quantization matrices (Q matrices), for  example, Q50_LUMINANCE and 
Q50_CHROMINANCE:

3 Proposed Design  
3.1 Choosing the Image Compression System 
In this proposal, we have used the basic system that is shown in Figure 2. Here, 
we have defined two subparts of the complete compression system: the 
supporting modules and the main compression module. The supporting modules 
consist of unsigned-to-signed and signed-to-unsigned modules. The main 
compression module consists of three main parts: a 8-point 1D-DCT block with 
transposition buffer, a 8-point 1D-IDCT block with transposition buffer, and 
Quantization-Dequantization blocks, as shown in Figure 3-4.  
 
            
Figure 3  Basic architecture in 2D-DCT.     Figure 4 Basic architecture in 2D-IDCT. 
 
This design approach was chosen in order to achieve the stated objectives, 
specifically the small area and low complexity. We did not choose a direct 2D-
DCT/IDT architecture, because of its huge area. Each 2D-DCT/IDCT design 
uses a transposition buffer to complete the 2D process. The area of the proposed 
design is smaller than the area of a direct 2D-DCT/IDCT. Obviously, our design 
needs more cycles to compare the process. 
3.2 Basic DCT/IDCT Matrices Equations 
We explore DCT/IDCT equations in Eqs. (1) and (2) to arrange the DCT/ IDCT 
matrices equations. The obtained matrices equations from the 8-point DCT 
process are shown in Eqs. (4) and (5), which are similar to the matrices 
equations from reference [9]. From these equations, we find a simple design for 
the digital hardware architecture.

We use several symbols in the DCT matrices equations (4) and (5). A brief 
explanation of the symbols: 
? Input of 8-point DCT process  : x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7 
? Output of 8-point DCT process  : z0, z1, z2, z3, z4, z5, z6, z7 
? Variables     : a, b, c, d, e, f 
 
By using a similar idea, we also get the IDCT matrices equations. A brief 
explanation of symbols used in IDCT process: 
? Input of 8-point IDCT process  : z0, z1, z2, z3, z4, z5, z6, z7 
? Output of 8-point IDCT process  : x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7

We will use the variables and expressions from this section for further 
exploration. 
3.3 Extracting the DCT/IDCT Matrices Equations

3.4 Fixed-Point Data Format 
We used a 20-bit data word-length, which consists of a 1-bit sign bit, 12bits of 
decimal data, and 7bits of fractional data. We chose a 12-bit data for decimal 
data because this accommodates the highest value that the compression process 
can reach. We chose a 7-bit data for fractional data because this is the shortest 
bit-length with a good performance in retaining image quality (high PSNR and 
low MSE value from modeling results, as shown in Figure 5). For the constant 
multipliers, we also used a 7-bit data as shown in Table 2.

3.5 Multiplication Decomposition Using the mCBE Algorithm 
It follows from Section 3.3 that we need multiplication by several constant 
multipliers. We know that multiplication can be substituted by a shift-add 
operation. Thus, we propose an algorithm to minimize the amount of shifter-
adder used to substitute the multiplication, which uses several constant 
multipliers. This is the multiplication from Common Binary Expression (mCBE) 
Algorithm.  
 
Figure 6   Illustration of the mCBE algorithm design. 
 DCT/IDCT-Based Img. Comp. Arch. Using mCBE Algorithm 139 
 
Here, we present the mCBE Algorithm: 
 
i. Listing of all constants (C1-n) which are used to multiply the same input, 
then produce a table as shown in Figure 6. 
ii. Choose and classify every constant which has bit value 1, more or equal to 
70% from its bitÅfs amount. There will be two groups: 
a. Group of [?70%]. 
b. Group of [<70%]. 
iii. Suppose there are 2 groups. 
a. Group of [?70%] : Group A. 
a.1  If only one constant fits in Group A, then: 
? Find out the most significant bit that contains the value of 1.  
? If the position is bit-m, choose bit-(m+1) as MostShiftBit.  
? Then, determine the SubShiftBit to complete the substraction 
operation in order to get the desired result. 
a.2  If there are several constants that fit in Group A, then: 
? For every constant, find out the most significant bit that 
contains the value of 1.  
? If the position is bit-m, choose bit-(m+1) as MostShiftBit.  
? Then, determine the SubShiftBit to complete the substraction 
operation in order to get the desired result.  
? If it is possible to use the same MostShiftBit or SubShiftBit, then 
use them together to fit other constants. 
b. Group of [<70%] : Group B. 
b.1  Find out the most appeared value of 1 for Vv (vertical view), and 
call it VvShiftBit. If there are several bits that fit, choose one. 
b.2  From the chosen VvShiftBit point, find the most appeared bit value 
of 1 for the corresponding Hv (horizontal view). We call this bit 
HvShiftBit. There are three possible conditions: single HvShiftBit 
found, several HvShiftBits found, or no HvShiftBit found. 
b.2.1 If there is a single HvShiftBit, then: 
? Choose this bit as AddShiftBit to the chosen VvShiftBit. 
? Then, still with the same VvShiftBit, check again from 
step (b.2) for unselected bits. 
b.2.2 If there are several HvShiftBits, then: 
Check whether between those HvShiftBits (Two or more 
HvShiftBits are grouped as HvShiftBitsG) there is a mutual 
inter-Hv relation (in the same constant).

used as shifting bit.

3.6 Implementation of the mCBE Algorithm 
3.6.1 Basic mCBE Building Blocks  
Implementation of the mCBE Algorithm occurs inside the multiplication block. 
From Table 1, we get three blocks (mCBE0, mCBE1, and mCBE2).

142 Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, et al. 
Then, we get the following architecture (Figure 9): 
 
 
Figure 9   The mCBE2 block architecture. 
 
In order to optimize the area consumption and retain a good image quality, we 
use some additional techniques. First, we expand the data word-length while the 
shifting process occurs in the mCBE0-2 blocks. Then, we cut the expanded data 
word-length at the last 7bits to represent 20-bit fixed-point data, right after the 
1D/2D-DCT/IDCT processes have been completed. 
 
3.7 Complete 8-Point 1D-DCT/IDCT Architecture 
The complete architecture is obtained by integrating the mCBE blocks with the 
remaining operations. The final 8-point 1D-DCT/IDCT architecture is shown in 
Figure 10-11.

Figure 11   The proposed 8-point 1D-IDCT architecture. 
 
From Figures 10 and 11, both designs (8-point 1D-DCT and 8-point 1D-IDCT) 
consist of 60 adders and 34 shifters. The 8-point 1D-DCT has six stages and the 
8-point 1D-IDCT has seven stages,where each stage is defined as the delay of 
one shifter or 2-input adder. The results fulfill the second and the third 
objective. The flow-graph architecture of each design has a less than 8- stage 
delay, without any iterations. Both designs only use shifter-adder components, 
so they have a low complexity and can be implemented easily in digital 
hardware. Furthermore, the designs can also easily be pipelined and modified 
for future improvement. 
3.8 Alternative Quantization-Dequantization Numbers 
In this paper we propose alternative quantization and dequantization numbers in 
order to simplify the hardware implementation without significantly reducing 
the image quality, based on the following considerations: 
1. Image Quality Consideration : The proposed quantization-dequantization 
numbers can mostly retain and improve compressed-image quality 
compared to JPEG recommendation numbers. This can be seen from the 
retaining or increasing of the Peak-to-peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) 
value and the Mean Square Error (MSE) values. 
144 Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, et al. 
2. Low Complexity Hardware Implementation : The proposed quantization-
dequantization numbers have to be implemented easily as shifter. 
 
In order to retain image quality and get low complexity hardware, we adopt the 
recommended quantization numbers as reference and change the value of the 
numbers slightly compared to the recommended numbers, which are a power of

For ease of reference, we call them FathQuantz numbers. If we use these 
numbers, there are consequences that we need to know. The design can be 
implemented easily as a shifter. However, the numbers are fixed, so we cannot 
make them change dynamically in the digital hardware, except if we design a 
supporting system for that case. In order to know the quality of the FathQuantz 
numbers, we examined them and compared the results with the reference 
numbers (JPEG recommendations, see Section 2.4). We use a comparison of 
PSNR and MSE values to show in how far there is a difference between the 
FathQuantz numbers and the reference numbers. The comparison results are 
shown in Figures 12-13. 
 
  Figure 12   Comparison of PSNR values   Figure 13   Comparison of MSE values. 
 
In Figures 12 and 13, we can see that the PSNR and MSE values are not 
significantly different between the reference and the FathQuantz numbers. The. 
FathQuantz numbers can mostly retain the image quality compared to the 
reference numbers. Therefore, we can use the FathQuantz numbers as 
quantization-dequantization numbers.

3.10 Pipelining Strategy 
As we all know, the best design conditions are built from low area consumption, 
high speed, and low latency. In our design, pipelining is purposely conducted to 
achieve a high throughput. Therefore, the pipelining strategy has to be 
conducted while taking area, speed, and latency into consideration. The 
pipelining strategy can be considered with two main conditions: 
1. Low latency : In order to achieve a low latency, no pipeline is given. 
2. High throughput : In order to achieve a high throughput, we can use a 
pipeline component to run a segmentation process. We can take several 
segments, such as: unsigned-to-signed data converter, 2D-DCT, 
quantization-dequantization, 2D-IDCT, and signed-to-unsigned data 
converter. If we want to add a number of pipelines to increase throughput, 
we can add them in the 1D-DCT/IDCT blocks to have segmentation in the 
process. However, we have to consider that adding pipelines also means 
adding area consumption and latency. 
 
We have tested two scenarios to establish the designÅfs boundaries. We tried the 
lowest latency design (without pipeline) and the highest throughput design 
(with the maximum amount of pipelines). We refer to the lowest latency design 
by its original name (e.g. DCT or IDCT) and to the highest latency design by 
adding Åg(p-)Åh in front of the name (e.g. p-DCT and p-IDCT). We will use the 
same references in the synthesis and benchmarks section. 
4 Design Synthesis and Benchmarks 
We have used Synopsys Design Vision with CMS-0.13É m technology to 
synthesize the designs. 
146 Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, et al. 
4.1 Parity Synthesis  
In order to make an easy comparison with other synthesis results, we also 
provide parity design. Parity design has a total 49 of 2-input XOR elements and 
21 stages (one stage is defined as the delay of one 2-input XOR element).

From Table 7, we get that the designs with lowest latency have a slower data 
arrival time (about 60 times slower) than the designs with highest latency.

From Tables 8 and 9, the proposed design has a smaller area and a faster data 
arrival time than the general multiplier method or the pure shift-add method. 
Moreover, the DCT/IDCT designs with mCBE algorithm are almost three times 
smaller and about two times faster than the multiplier-based architecture. The 
proposed design is also smaller and faster than a pure shift-add architecture. In 
Tables 10 and 11, we show the results of the comparison between the proposed 
design and other proposed designs, such as the designs from references [6], [7], 
[8] and [9]. The results show that our design can reach all three design 
objectives (small area, multiplierless, and low complexity). Moreover, the 
proposed design can achieve a high speed and relatively low latency compared 
to the other designs. 
5 Verification and Implementation 
In order to verify the functional performance of our design, we used MATLAB 
and Modelsim software (see Figures 15-20). First, we generated the image data 
file by using MATLAB. This file was read by our Verilog HDL codes and 
computed in Modelsim. The output of the compression system in Modelsim was 
written to a new file. Then, this file was read and reconstructed as a picture by 
MATLAB. In this step, we also compared the original image with the 
compressed one by using the PSNR and MSE computation method.

 Figure 19  Cropped original picture.    Figure 20  Cropped compressed picture. 
 
The reconstructed compressed image data were computed using MATLAB to 
examine the PSNR and MSE values. Figure 18, the reconstructed image, has 
PSNR = 41.808dB and MSE = 4.289. From the example, we notice that the 
compressed image was slightly more blurred. Considering the PSNR and MSE 
values which we have obtained from several functional verifications, we 
conclude that our system can obtain a good compressed-image quality. This 
means that we have reached the first goal: the proposed design can operate well, 
producing a compressed image of good quality. 
Our design has also been implemented in FPGA board Altera DE2 Cyclone II 
EP2C35F672C6. For FPGA implementation, we used the internal ROM to store 
the image data and compute them to give output. The computation output was 
presented using FPGAÅfs LED to indicate whether the output data were valid or 
not. This FPGA implementation results show that the proposed design works 
well and gives valid output data.  
150 Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, et al. 
6 Conclusion 
We conclude that our design can reach all three objectives successfully. The 
mCBE Algorithm can minimize the amount of shifter-adders to substitute 
multipliers. Besides that, our alternative quantization-dequantization numbers 
can mostly retain good compressed-image quality compared to JPEG 
recommendations. The results of this research show that the proposed 8-point 
1D-DCT design has only six stages and the 8-point 1D-IDCT design has only 
seven stages. Here, we define one stage as equal to the delay of one shifter or 2-
input adder. By using the pipelining method, we can achieve a high-speed 
architecture with latency as trade-off consideration. This design has been 
synthesized and it can reach speeds of up to 1.41ns critical path delay 
(709.22MHz).
